Admittedly , the strategic conditions in the region are far more complex today than they were eight years ago , when Israel 's requirements for a deal with Syria focused mainly on security arrangements on the Golan Heights , and on Syria using its leverage in Lebanon to permit an Israeli settlement with that country .
Indeed , both Israel and the United States are adamant about excluding Hamas from the Annapolis process unless and until it recognizes Israel 's right to exist , while Hamas will not abandon its identity as a resistance movement merely to join negotiations that seem unlikely to satisfy the Palestinian people 's minimal requirements .
The meager results of the Oslo peace process are regarded by Hamas as vindication of its consistent view that the Oslo accords were doomed to failure , and that Israel and America never intended to respect the minimal requirements of Palestinian nationalism .

Yet Erdogan has also been eager to use Europe 's requirements as a pretext to curb the army 's capacity to check his Islamic revolution .
The end of the conflict , like the requirement that Israel be recognized as a Jewish state , is a concept that has unnecessarily acquired mythical meaning .
Rather , failure stemmed from the inherent incapacity of both parties to reconcile themselves to each other 's fundamental requirements for a settlement .
The US had two requirements of Mubarak : that he undertake domestic political reform , and that he be a peace broker in the region .
But the EU 's `` Battlegroups '' are a first response to this requirement .
In responding to the higher capital requirements imposed by authorities , and choosing whether to raise more capital or sell off assets , the banks must take into account the important role that their subsidiaries play in many countries .
Merely to insist , as some legal purists want , on the sanctity of existing agreements , is not enough ; if they were adequate for past international requirements , this does not mean they are viable in a time when non-state actors are muscling into an arena hitherto monopolized by states .
It will require years of hard work to reconcile America 's resources and requirements , and to ensure that its initiatives can once again be seen as designed not to serve narrow US ideologies , but to advance a fair international order .
Bankers , who may really be worried about their own bonuses , warn that higher capital requirements will force them to curtail lending , thus impeding economic growth .

Confronted with the prospect of a US veto , an increasing number of international observers flatly oppose the Palestinian plan , on the grounds that it is unlikely to generate concrete political gains and would merely deflect attention from the main requirement of Middle East peace-making : a return to the negotiating table .
With respect to financial supervision , there has been increasing support since the crisis for countercyclical capital requirements , at least for banks .
Such countercyclical capital requirements are likely to be added to the toolkit of macroprudential rules and policies , the use of which has risen as enthusiasm for light-touch financial supervision has faded .
Those tools include caps , linked to borrowers ' characteristics , on loan-to-value ratios ; direct limits on currency and maturity mismatches in financial institutions ' balance sheets ; limits on their balance sheets ' interconnectedness ; and minimum reserve requirements for specific financial instruments .
A second requirement is that we look ahead more effectively .
New visa requirements and other obstacles to travel , more intimate data collected by governments , and the presence of video cameras everywhere -- at once benign and intrusive -- remind one more of George Orwell 's Big Brother than of John Stuart Mill 's On Liberty .
No one has any idea how to run a Union of 25 or more member states -- not even in terms of basic logistics , starting with the geometric escalation in translation requirements .

Such a requirement would impose costs on universal banks by constraining their ability to transfer capital within the group .
But a wide gap has opened up between the financial authorities and the banks on the costs and benefits of the much higher requirements now demanded by Basel .
Basel 3 , the Basel Committee 's new global regulatory standard on banks ' capital adequacy and liquidity , will more or less double the equity requirements , and will impose extra costs on banks deemed `` too big to fail . ''
In sharp contrast , the Institute of International Finance , the leading trade association for the world 's top banks , believes that the impact of higher capital requirements could be far stronger .
Regulators take the view that the impact of higher capital requirements on the cost of credit to borrowers will be modest , as the overall cost of funds to banks will not rise much .
Politicians and regulators are exploring a number of options , from higher tax rates , through fines for certain types of bonus arrangements , to variable capital requirements .

Indeed , the Basel Committee plans to require more capital in the future , though the new requirements will be delayed , owing to concerns about the cost and availability of credit to sustain the recovery .
In order to enter into force around the world before 2013 , the Copenhagen agreement must meet the political requirements of all participating countries .
The reform 's centerpiece is a requirement imposed by the government that people choose responsibly and provide themselves with insurance -- albeit with the government willing to subsidize the poor and strengthen the bargaining power of the weak .
Keynes , in his General Theory of Employment , Interest and Money , set out the framework that nearly all macroeconomists use today . That framework is based on spending and demand , the determinants of the components of spending , the liquidity-preference theory of short-run interest rates , and the requirement that government make strategic but powerful interventions in the economy to keep it on an even keel and avoid extremes of depression and manic excess .
In the United States , the average earnings premium received by those with four-year college degrees over those with no college has gone from 30 % to 90 % over the past three decades , as the economy 's skill requirements have outstripped the educational system 's ability to meet them .
The requirement that evictions take place only for a valid `` public purpose , '' with fair compensation , and following consultation of those affected , is honored more in the breach than in the observance .

That uniform individual cost incentive allows total CO2 to be reduced at a lower total cost than would be achieved by a variety of administrative requirements , such as automobile mileage standards , production technology standards -LRB- e.g. , minimum renewable fuel inputs in electricity generation -RRB- , etc. .
That , in turn , avoids triggering requirements of more bank capital .
I believe that the government will act on all of these reasons for high saving , making credit more widely available , introducing a health insurance system , and relaxing some of the down-payment requirements .

But there is an iron clad requirement for coordination to be genuinely effective : both central banks must see prevailing exchange rates as being in conflict with their domestic policy objectives and share the view that intervention can have a sustainable impact on the exchange rate .
Indeed , because standard measures of the probability of default fall when the economy is doing well and rise when it is not , capital requirements based on these measures tend to be pro-cyclical .
The G-20 has now called for revising the Basel II standards so that capital requirements become countercyclical , and Spain 's experience with such requirements suggests that doing so is a step in the right direction .
As a result , not only are countercyclical measures needed , but banks ' capital requirements should vary inversely with the boom-and-bust fluctuations in the asset markets to which they are heavily exposed .
One possible measure is to announce `` guidance ranges '' for asset prices , with targeted variations of margin and capital requirements , not to eliminate , but to help damp down movements outside these ranges .
The decisions to appoint , rather than elect , regional governors , to introduce party-list voting , to raise the electoral threshold for parties to enter the Duma , and to repeal the minimum-turnout requirement -- all accompanied by rampant manipulation of elections and the mass media -- created a political system closed to feedback from society .
We have approached the point when the constitutional requirement of universal , free education may become a fiction .
The nuclear powers should adhere to the requirements of the 1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty and resume `` good faith '' negotiations for disarmament .

Palestinians complied with all Israeli and international requirements for security , while Binyamin Netanyahu 's Israeli government , which gives lip-service to the two-state solution , has yet to elucidate where Israel 's borders will be .
Meanwhile , the Israeli government wants to continue building settlements in occupied areas , in total violation of international law and the minimum requirements for peace detailed in the `` roadmap '' sponsored by the Quartet -LRB- the US , UN , European Union , and Russia -RRB- .

We need to ensure transparency and adequate risk management , measures on which are part of my proposal on capital requirements .
The current European and global frameworks for accounting standards and capital requirements , for example , have exacerbated turmoil in the markets .
That is why I recently proposed a measure to provide firms with more flexibility on mark-to-market requirements and to facilitate asset transfer from the trading book to the banking book .
This issue aside , I have never been persuaded that capital requirements on trading books should be materially lower than for those on banking books .
Much tougher capital requirements for trading-book exposures are therefore needed and will be brought forward as soon as possible .
The fact that equity-to-asset ratios are currently averaging out at about 3 % tells you everything that you need to know about the inadequacy of the current pro-cyclical capital requirement framework .
Again , this must be a feature of further revisions to the capital requirement framework for banks .
But even where the European Commission had the legislative tools and political mandate to impose sanctions -- for example , to punish non-compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact -- member states managed to avoid punishment by `` reforming '' the requirements .

Similarly , a task force of the 165-member Codex Alimentarius Commission , the joint food standards program of the UN 's World Health Organization and its Food and Agriculture Organization , has singled out only food products made with GM for various Draconian and even bizarre regulatory procedures and requirements .
In July , the full Codex membership approved various procedures and requirements that are more appropriate to potentially dangerous prescription drugs or pesticides than to GM tomatoes , potatoes , and strawberries .
By contrast , plants constructed with less precise techniques such as hybridization or mutagenesis generally are subject to no government scrutiny or requirements -LRB- or opposition from activists -RRB- at all .

Moreover , rising gasoline prices have called attention to the shortcomings of the Bush administration 's energy policy , which includes recently passed legislation that contains inadequate requirements for energy conservation . The press , meanwhile , has reported on speculation about the relationship between warmer ocean waters and the frequency of severe hurricanes , thus highlighting the low priority that the administration has given to environmental problems in general and global climate change in particular .
Bush administration officials argue that the new plan is `` not an open-ended commitment : we are putting real , specific requirements and expectations on the Iraqi government . ''
Some resorted to capital-account regulations on inflows , such as taxes on the foreign purchases of bonds , equities , and derivatives , reserve requirements on short-term inflows , and so forth .
A reserve requirement on cross-border flows is one of them .
High capital and provision requirements for certain transactions , or prohibition of such transactions , should also be introduced for prudential reasons .
At the source , capital requirements for currency mismatches in portfolios , together with margin requirements on foreign-exchange derivatives , make sense .
One of them is a reserve requirement on cross-border flows -- successfully implemented in Chile , Colombia , and elsewhere -- or , even better , on cross-border liabilities .
Alternatively , if those economic actors borrow from domestic financial institutions , regulations could resemble recent measures adopted in Brazil and South Korea , which include high capital and provision requirements for the associated liabilities .

These trends imply an increased probability that the market is underestimating risk , so systemic risk regulators should raise minimum capital requirements as soon as they spot them .
Counter-cyclical capital requirements fit with this idea , and a range of indicators could be used to calibrate the increase in capital requirements , coupled perhaps with some discretion .
But it makes the case for novel measures , including `` guidance ranges '' for asset prices and targeted variation of margin and capital requirements , to help dampen such excessive price movements .

The full competition and information requirements ensure that all contracts are uncoerced -LRB- there is no monopoly power -RRB- and all expectations are fulfilled , i.e. , people get what they want .
Finally , the reduction of governments ' borrowing requirements `` might '' have a beneficial effect on output in the long run , owing to lower long-term interest rates .

Higher and pro-cyclical equity-capital requirements on banks , combined with a requirement to raise contingent long-term debt -- debt that converts into equity in a crisis -- is a better way forward .
Regulators might consider imposing pro-cyclical equity requirements -- increasing the equity percentage in boom times in order to offset losses in the inevitable bust times .
Over time , however , the interest-rate premium is likely to be small , because higher capital requirements and contingent capital should significantly reduce the likelihood of ever reaching the triggers .
Today , however , opaque bilateral agreements abound , and very different environmental requirements and contradictory subsidies coexist .
We must abandon Popper 's tacit assumption that political discourse aims at a better understanding of reality and reintroduce it as an explicit requirement .
The best-known tools for this are margin requirements and minimum capital requirements .
The globalization of financial markets that took place since the 1980 's allowed financial capital to move freely around the world , making it difficult to tax or regulate .

Instead of imposing requirements , it would be much better to provide resources to enable poor countries to comply on a voluntary basis .
But the fullest possible information in executing trades is a necessary condition : hence the imposition of pre-trade -LRB- posting orders and prices -RRB- and post-trade transparency for intermediaries trading on their own account with retail investors - a requirement that has been firmly opposed by all the states where the relevant `` internalizers '' reside .
Thus , while certain necessary requirements for the existence of a single European financial market have been established , they are far from sufficient , at least at the retail level .

That is why King , Paul Volcker , the United Nations Commission of Experts on Reforms of the International Monetary and Financial System , and a host of others are right about the need to curb the big banks . What is required is a multi-prong approach , including special taxes , increased capital requirements , tighter supervision , and limits on size and risk-taking activities .
Banks will have to recognize the losses and , if necessary , find the additional capital to meet reserve requirements .
Similarly , changes in voting procedures -LRB- public voting by countries , rather than through constituencies , or a requirement that candidates win the support of a majority of developing and emerging countries -RRB- could persuade more emerging-market officials to put their names forward .
Making all payments to governments transparent would bring further progress , and Western governments could encourage this simply by tying this requirement to tax deductibility .
No requirements were put on developing countries , yet within the not-too-distant future , they will contribute half or more of emissions .
To avoid catastrophe , the world community must also meet the urgent emergency food and planting requirements mentioned above , including more generous budget and balance-of-payments support for low-income food-importing countries .
The press and government , mindful of the requirements of EU membership , are finally opening the sensitive Armenian issue to debate .
Reporting requirements are onerous and often impose huge administrative burdens on developing countries , which must devote the scarce skills of educated , English-speaking personnel to writing reports for donors rather than running programs .
These could include higher capital or provisioning requirements as buffers for more difficult times , or the stipulation of liquidity standards and special requirements for systemically important banks in order to avoid a recurrence of the `` too big to fail '' dilemma that many countries -- not only in the EBRD region -- have been facing .
Are we happy to live in a world where the rich can rely on ever more clever technical tricks , while we ignore the right of poor countries and communities to the basic requirements of survival ?
In fact , this requirement is rooted in history .
For example , regulation to protect retail customers could , sometimes , be appropriate : requirements for information disclosure could help overcome asymmetries of information between businesses and consumers .
The bottom line is that the current version of US biofuels policy , with its fixed requirement for blending , leads to a greater price response in the event of a crop shortfall -- in the short run .
If , on the other hand , we believe that economic actors will respond rationally to incentives and information , then we can usefully reform regulatory frameworks with well-targeted measures , including restrictions on off-balance sheet vehicles , tougher disclosure requirements , and controls on rating agencies ' conflicts of interests .
Firms can be made to internalize the costs they impose on society with appropriate regulation -LRB- for example , capital requirements with a systemic charge for financial institutions -RRB- , but it is not so obvious what to do with `` excessive '' influence that comes with size .
In an ideal world , the competition-stability trade-off could be regulated away with sophisticated risk-based insurance mechanisms , credible liquidation and resolution procedures , contingent convertibles , and capital requirements with charges for systemic institutions .
For example , capital charges should account for the degree of friction and rivalry in the banking sector , with tighter requirements in more competitive contexts .
What information requirements must banks comply with ?
Perhaps every country should vote in the UN General Assembly on how to proceed ; the option receiving the most votes -- with a possible mandatory minimum requirement , such as requiring an alternative to win a majority or some higher number of votes -- would prevail .
Expectations of a greater FSB focus on shadow banking stem not only from non-bank financial institutions ' role in fueling the 2008-2009 crisis , but also from the concern that stiffer capital and liquidity requirements for banks might shift risk away from the financial sector 's regulated core .
As a result , the People 's Bank of China has raised interest rates substantially and increased banks ' reserve requirements .
Finally , one must ask : is there a psychological element to the US requirement of submission to genital groping by uniformed officials ?
If we want to intervene on pay in addition to -LRB- not instead of -RRB- reforming capital requirements , the most effective way is a variation of the tax imposed by former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown : a special tax on all compensation above a certain threshold that is not paid in stock .
To fix this problem , we need to move the bulk of derivative trading onto organized exchanges , where daily collateral requirements would guarantee systemic stability , and price transparency would force competition , reduce margins , and increase the market 's depth .
