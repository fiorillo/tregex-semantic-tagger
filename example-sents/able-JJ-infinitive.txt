Musharraf 's Last Act ?
Musharraf 's Last Act ?
Desperate to hold onto power , Pervez Musharraf has discarded Pakistan 's constitutional framework and declared a state of emergency .
His goal ?
To stifle the independent judiciary and free media .
Artfully , though shamelessly , he has tried to sell this action as an effort to bring about stability and help fight the war on terror more effectively .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
If Pakistan 's history is any indicator , his decision to impose martial law may prove to be the proverbial straw that breaks the camel 's back .
General Musharraf appeared on the national scene on October 12 , 1999 , when he ousted an elected government and announced an ambitious `` nation-building '' project .
Many Pakistanis , disillusioned with Pakistan 's political class , remained mute , thinking that he might deliver .
The September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks on America brought Musharraf into the international limelight as he agreed to ditch the Taliban and support the United States-led war on terror .
Musharraf clamped down on some religious militants operating inside Pakistan and also on those fighting Indian forces in Kashmir .
As a result , Pakistan was rewarded with American financial assistance and arms .
In furtherance of his re-alignment , Musharraf sent the Pakistani army into the tribal areas bordering Afghanistan for the first time since Pakistan 's independence .
Operations there against Taliban and al-Qaeda forces brought mixed results .
Although the US viewed Musharraf as an agent of change , he has never achieved domestic political legitimacy , and his policies were seen as rife with contradictions .
For example , he made alliances with Islamist political forces -LRB- who in 2004 voted for constitutional changes legitimizing his position and actions -RRB- . At the same time , he sidelined moderate , mainstream political leaders while claiming that he stood for `` enlightened moderation . ''
A series of ill-planned military operations in the tribal areas further complicated the situation in the volatile border region .
Last March , Musharraf took his boldest step , removing the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court , Iftikhar Chaudhry .
To the surprise of many , the country 's legal community organized a nation-wide movement to restore the Chief Justice to his post .
Hundreds of thousands of ordinary people demanded the rule of law and the supremacy of the constitution , emboldening the judiciary and changing the country 's political dynamic .
In a historic ruling that Musharraf had little choice but to accept , the Supreme Court itself reinstated the Chief Justice in July .
Subsequently , the energized judiciary continued ruling against government decisions , embarrassing the government -- especially its intelligence agencies .
Government officials were held accountable for actions that were usually beyond the reach of the law , ranging from brutal beatings of journalists , to illegal confinement for `` national security . ''
Musharraf and his political allies tried to adjust to this new reality , but their patience ran out when the Supreme Court took up petitions against Musharraf 's decision to run for president .
According to the constitution -LRB- originally promulgated in 1973 by an elected parliament -RRB- , a serving military official can not run for an elected office .
Musharraf was not ready to give up his military post , but also wanted to be a civilian president .
While he announced that he would leave his military position `` if '' he was elected president , his track record of reneging on his promises haunted the judiciary .
The proceedings of the court over the last few weeks made Musharraf jittery . The decision of the 11-member bench might easily have gone against him .
Legally cornered , Musharraf has now decided to abandon constitutionality , removing the leading judges of the Supreme Court and provincial high courts and putting curbs on the media .
Lawyers , human rights activists , and political leaders have since been arrested .
There is widespread public resentment in response to these moves .
Rather than taking responsibility for the deteriorating security situation -LRB- as evidenced by regular suicide bomb attacks -RRB- and the increasing Talibanization of the tribal areas , Musharraf has tried to blame the judiciary and media .
To be sure , in some cases , judicial activism was obvious -LRB- though within the realm of constitutional law -RRB- , and the media also made mistakes ; but by no stretch of the imagination can these be linked to religious extremism or support for militancy .
It is unlikely that Musharraf 's latest gambit will succeed , as his popular support is at its lowest ebb .
Pakistan 's armed forces -- repeated targets of suicide bombers -- have become demoralized .
It is difficult to imagine them standing with Musharraf should civil conflict erupt .
Nor can a weak , embattled , and disoriented Musharraf be expected to fight Islamic militancy effectively or bring political stability to Pakistan .
Opposition political parties are drawing closer together , and former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto , despite progress in her power-sharing negotiations with Musharraf , has strongly condemned his actions .
Human rights bodies , media associations , and lawyers ' organizations are expected to defy the emergency , which will pit them against the security forces .
Terrorists may also benefit by attacking a preoccupied army and political forces aligned with Musharraf .
In the event of sustained protests and potential violence , top military commanders may decide to send Musharraf home -- a decision that would not be unprecedented in Pakistan 's chronically turbulent history .
The Making of a Murder in Pakistan
The Making of a Murder in Pakistan The assassination of Benazir Bhutto , the first Muslim woman to lead a Muslim country , is a serious blow to Pakistan 's prospects for democracy and , indeed , its viability as a state .
As chaos and confusion set in , we should not lose sight of President Pervez Musharraf 's partial responsibility for this turn of events . At the very least , he can not be absolved from his government 's failure to provide Bhutto with adequate security .
Instead , Bhutto had to pay with her life for courageously challenging extremists of all stripes -- from Al-Qaeda and Taliban to the country 's religious political parties and military hardliners .
As heir to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto , the legendary democratic leader who was hanged by General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq 's government in 1979 , Benazir emerged as a symbol of resistance at a young age -- but languished in jails and exile in the 1980 's .
Z. A. Bhutto 's legacy was empowerment of the impoverished and defense of ordinary people 's rights amid feudalistic politics and military rule .
Rather than bowing to the military junta , he embraced the gallows .
Hours before his hanging , Benazir was allowed to see her father for the last time , writing in her autobiography : `` I told him on my oath in his death cell , I would carry on his work . ''
She largely lived up to the promise .
Her first stint as prime minister -LRB- 1988-90 -RRB- was brief and disorganized .
Lt. Gen. Hamid Gul , the former Inter-Services Intelligence -LRB- ISI -RRB- chief , confirmed that he sponsored an alliance of right-wing political parties to stop her from getting a parliamentary majority .
Information about Pakistan 's nuclear program and ISI operations in Afghanistan were out of her domain .
Her second term in office -LRB- 1993-96 -RRB- was longer and better , but her government again fell early , owing to charges of mismanagement and corruption .
In reality , machinations by the intelligence agencies also played a part .
The military had developed an entrenched distrust of her , given her position as a popularly supported pro-Western leader who wanted peace with India .
After almost a decade in self-imposed exile , Bhutoo 's return to Pakistan in October gave her a fresh political start .
Pakistan had changed , as military dictatorship and religious extremism in the north played havoc with the fabric of society .
A tentative arrangement with Musharraf , together with Western support -- particularly from the United Kingdom and the United States -- eased her return , which hundreds of thousands of people welcomed , though terrorists greeted her with a string of suicide bombings .
Bhutto 's contacts with Mushararf 's military government drew criticism , but she remained adamant that a return to democracy was possible only through a transition in which Musharraf would give up his military post , become a civilian head of state , and conduct free and fair elections .
To the dismay of some democratic forces , Bhutto stayed the course even after Musharraf imposed emergency rule on November 3 and removed the country 's top judges to ensure his re-election .
Indeed , she even persuaded other important political leaders to participate in the planned January 8 election , which she viewed as an opportunity to challenge religious extremist forces in the public square .
She seized that opportunity by bravely traveling throughout the country , despite serious threats to her life , arguing for a democratic and pluralistic Pakistan .
One can understand why religious extremists like Al-Qaeda and Taliban would target her , and the government claims that it is impossible to defend against a suicide attack .
But Bhutto was reportedly killed by a sharp shooter before the terrorist blew himself up .
So , in the eyes of Pakistan 's people , and especially of Bhutto 's supporters , the intelligence services , either alone or in collaboration with extremists , finally decided to eliminate her .
Whether or not the government was involved , the fact remains that Pakistan has lost a desperately needed leader .
With Pakistan 's future in the balance , the West 's help and support will be crucial , but that means recognizing that Musharraf is not the only leader who can resolve Pakistan 's myriad problems and manage the war on terror .
On the contrary , by nurturing the current environment of instability and uncertainty , Musharraf himself must be regarded as one of Pakistan 's biggest problems .
Exorcising Musharraf 's Ghost
Exorcising Musharraf 's Ghost CAMBRIDGE -- Following its recent free elections , Pakistan is rebounding politically .
But the euphoria that came with the end of the Musharraf era is wearing off , as the new government faces stark choices .
Unlike Iraq and Afghanistan , democracy is not new to this 60-year-old state , but ethnic cleavages , weak institutions , and religious extremism in the North are perennially destabilizing .
And , while the new government settles in and establishes its priorities , the West , especially the United States , must reassess the impact of its past dealings with Pakistan .
Pakistan 's new prime minister , Yousaf Gilani , is a seasoned politician and , more importantly , has Sufi family roots , which is a good omen because of the Sufi tradition of tolerance .
Gilani unequivocally declared in his inaugural address that fighting terrorism is a top priority , and his first decision was to release from house arrest judges deposed by Musharraf .
The respite from the horrendous spate of suicide bombings since the new government assumed power is similarly heartening .
But the honeymoon period is coming to an end .
Already , in Gilani 's hometown of Multan , rioters attacked government offices and banks to protest electricity disruptions .
A couple of well-known opposition politicians , a chief minister and a federal cabinet minister of the previous pro-Musharraf government , were publicly thrashed , raising doubts about government control over law and order in the country .
So far , Musharraf has accepted his diminishing stature quietly -- though he has few other options .
The new political leadership , both inside and outside the parliament , has been carefully avoiding a head-on collision with the president .
Interestingly , in the midst of the political transition , Musharraf embarked on a week-long visit to China to lobby for construction of an oil and gas pipeline between China and the Persian Gulf that would be routed through Pakistan .
The deeper question raised by this proposal is whether Musharraf meant to convey a message to the US that Pakistan 's priorities were shifting .
The revival of democratic politics in Pakistan will undoubtedly effect Pakistan-US relations .
Pakistan 's military links with America appear to remain on a sound footing , so the strategic alliance with the US is likely to continue , perhaps with some nuanced differences over how to fight the `` war on terror . ''
But Pakistani politicians are bound to be influenced by domestic public opinion , which is generally critical of US policies .
Nevertheless , long-term US interests in the region will be better served if Pakistan 's democratic forces successfully establish themselves .
A proposal in the US Senate to increase development and education aid to Pakistan could help in winning the hearts and minds .
Meanwhile , President George W. Bush has said that `` if another September 11-style attack is being planned , it probably is being plotted in Pakistan and not Afghanistan . ''
Whether this American intelligence assessment is based on credible information is unknown .
American election-year politics may also be behind this assertion .
But it is significant that Bush decided to voice this view during Pakistan 's political transition .
Pakistan must take this view seriously , regardless of Bush 's motivations .
The new government should quickly devise a policy to deal with terrorism .
Recent months have seen dozens of suicide bombings and other terrorist activities -- the price of Pakistan 's own past blunders , as well as those of the West .
Afghanistan is a prime example , as is the failure to settle the Kashmir imbroglio with India .
Both failures have strengthened domestic terrorist groups .
Pakistan 's government appears to be preparing to talk to some of the extremists in the tribal areas , introduce political reforms , and redouble development efforts .
But reference to `` talks '' makes the West uncomfortable .
American officials have likened this strategy to negotiating with terrorists , and point to a previous round of negotiations that did nothing to stop violence in the tribal areas .
But the new leadership wants to distinguish between al-Qaeda terrorists and religious conservatives and disillusioned Pashtun youth within Pakistan . After all , the victory of the secular Awami National Party -LRB- ANP -RRB- in Pakistan 's North-West Frontier Province is a strong indication that people there have rejected religious political forces and violence .
This window of opportunity can be expanded through dialogue and reconciliation with those who are ready to disavow extremism and militancy .
The new Pakistani government needs to explain this to the West in order to keep its support .
The US , meanwhile , should end direct military strikes in the area , even if these are conducted with the knowledge and cooperation of Pakistan 's military .
Force has never worked with the Pashtun tribes , and there is no evidence that this has changed .
There are real signs that the new government is considered a credible partner in the tribal areas .
It needs to be given time to find a way out of the endless cycle of violence .
Pervez Musharraf 's Long Goodbye
Pervez Musharraf 's Long Goodbye ISLAMABAD -- Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan stands virtually alone today while facing the most serious challenge to his presidency : possible impeachment by the new democratically-elected government .
The potential charges are serious : conspiring to destabilize the government that was elected last February , unlawfully removing the country 's top judges in November 2007 , and failing to provide adequate security to Benazir Bhutto before her assassination last December .
Allying himself with the Bush administration has increased his unpopularity , especially following missile attacks by the United States in Pakistan 's tribal areas .
Despite earlier differences on how to deal with Musharraf , Pakistan 's leading political parties are now united against him .
Feuding between the Pakistan People 's Party , led by Benazir 's widower , Asif Ali Zardari , and the Pakistan Muslim League -LRB- N -RRB- , led by former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif , had given Musharraf a chance to regain some standing after his allies were defeated in the February elections .
American reluctance to abandon Musharraf -- together with prolonged electricity shortages , which made the new government appear incompetent -- also raised his hopes .
Musharraf may be counting on the army , his primary constituency , to bail him out of this crisis .
Though such support remains a possibility , it is unlikely that the army leadership will extend itself on his behalf .
Though a protégé of Musharraf , the army 's chief of staff , General Ashfaq Kayani , is a professional soldier for whom the army 's institutional interests are more important than the political interests of his former army boss .
Kayani has repeatedly declared that the army will not interfere in political affairs , and that the parliament and constitution are supreme .
Even if the army is tempted to step in on Musharraf 's behalf , it has been chastened by political developments during the past year .
The entire legal community arose to demand restoration of the country 's judges and reinforcement of the rule of law .
The public 's demand for free elections and the resulting creation of a democratic government have forced the military to accept the public will .
The army has also paid a heavy price for Musharraf 's approach to the war on terror . Suicide bombers have struck repeatedly at military installations and personnel around the army 's headquarters in Rawalpindi .
An increase in deadly attacks on army convoys in the Pakistan-Afghanistan tribal areas has also pushed the army away from Musharraf .
Though the army has reaped a financial windfall from US military aid , and has targeted many foreign militants allied with al-Qaeda in the region , its performance against Pakistani militants has been mixed at best .
Consequently , the prestige of the Taliban and other militant groups operating in the area has grown .
In this context , the army , seeking to avoid sole responsibility for reverses , wants a popular government to take charge of policy . No such government can emerge if the elected parties are unseated .
Nevertheless , there are signs of disagreement on important matters between the government and the army .
The military recently blocked a government move to place Pakistan 's infamous intelligence service , the ISI , under the control of the interior minister rather than the prime minister .
Musharraf backed the military 's opposition to this reform , gaining some gratitude from military commanders .
During Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani 's recent visit to the US , President Bush repeatedly said that his administration supports Pakistan 's democracy , a policy since reiterated by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice .
This indicates that the US will not back Musharraf in any confrontation between him and Pakistan 's democratic forces . Most Pakistanis hope so .
Musharraf must assess what will be his legacy .
Rather than trying to face down impeachment and prolonging the crisis , he should recognize that Pakistan can not afford more instability , and that giving up honorably will bring him some respect .
In March 2009 , the current ruling coalition will gain more seats in the Senate , and the government would almost certainly try to impeach him again .
Moreover , any attempt by Musharraf to dislodge the government by using his constitutional authority would trigger another election , the results of which would not be much different from the vote in February .
It is time for Musharraf 's friends in the West to press him to serve his country one last time , by avoiding confrontation with his country 's democratic forces and calling it quits .
South Asia at War
South Asia at War CAMBRIDGE -- Last month 's terrorist assault in Mumbai targeted not only India 's economy and sense of security . Its broader goal was to smash the India-Pakistan détente that has been taking shape since 2004 .
The attackers did not hide their faces or blow themselves up with suicide jackets .
Anonymity was not their goal . They wanted to be identified as defenders of a cause .
Unless this cause is fully understood , and its roots revealed across the region , this attack may prove to be the beginning of the unmaking of South Asia .
Regional conflict , involving all of the region 's states and increasing numbers of non-state actors , has produced large numbers of trained fighters , waiting for the call to glory .
Within both India and Pakistan , economic disparities and a sense of social injustice have created fertile ground for conflict .
The use and abuse of religious fervor , whether `` jihadi '' or `` Hindu fundamentalist , '' are striking at the roots of communal harmony across South Asia .
Much of the current trouble can be traced to Afghanistan , whose tragedy could never have remained confined within its designated borders .
The dynamics of the region changed when the Afghan freedom fighters of 1980 's were converted into `` mujahidin '' through a criminal enterprise in which both the West and the Muslim world happily participated .
Pakistan , always insecure about India , became the hub of this transformation .
The West thought it had moved on after the fall of the Soviet empire , but the region -- and increasingly the global community -- continues to pay a heavy price for this unholy project .
The ills of two decades in South Asia can be attributed to the Afghan jihad years : the rise of the Taliban , the dominance of Pakistani-sponsored religious fanatics within the Kashmir freedom movement , and the eventual spread of sectarian conflict within Pakistan .
In Afghanistan , Pakistan 's military and intelligence agencies sought `` strategic depth '' against India .
Moreover , they wanted payback for India 's role in supporting the revolt in the 1960 's and 1970 's that led to Bangladesh 's independence from Pakistan .
India is not blameless here .
It was pursuing a two-pronged strategy -- making the argument that all was well in Kashmir -LRB- a blatant lie -RRB- and supporting ethnic confrontation in Pakistan .
Violent intelligence wars between Pakistan 's Inter-Services Intelligence -LRB- ISI -RRB- and India 's Research and Analysis Wing -LRB- RAW -RRB- have become a brutal reality in South Asia .
Lashkar-e-Taiba -LRB- LET , Army of the Pure -RRB- , a Pakistan-based militant outfit supporting insurgency on the Indian side of Kashmir , was a product of these years .
According to Indian investigators , this group is implicated in the Mumbai attacks .
Pakistan 's clampdown on its offices throughout the country essentially confirms this conclusion , though Pakistan is publicly demanding more evidence .
LET was the armed wing of an Ahle-Hadith organization , a South Asian version of Saudi-style fundamentalism , whose purpose was to hit Indian forces in Kashmir .
Though the group was banned by former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf after the terrorist attacks on the United States of September 11 , 2001 , some of its operators went underground and others joined Jamaat-ud-Dawa -LRB- JuD , Party of Proselytizing -RRB- -- an organization that runs religious educational centers and charities .
Given its established linkages with Pakistan 's intelligence outfits , the group was never targeted strongly .
In fact , it was even involved in rescue operations on the Pakistani side of Kashmir after the devastating 2005 earthquake there .
What Pakistan 's military strategists failed to realize was that groups like LET and JuD had local agendas as well -- converting Pakistan into a theocracy .
Hafiz Saeed , the founder of LET and currently the head of JuD , once proudly argued that : `` We believe in the Clash of Civilizations , and our Jihad will continue until Islam becomes the dominant religion . ''
JuD , along with many other like-minded groups , radicalized thousands of young Pakistanis .
Through its web and print publications , it also routinely challenged the teachings of the Sufi mystics who originally brought Islam to South Asia by promoting pluralism and love for humanity .
Even while demanding strong action against JuD , India must recognize that Pakistan is itself a victim of terror .
Any military confrontation with Pakistan will only empower Pakistani radicals .
India also needs to look inward , as anti-Muslim violence in Gujarat and the activities of Hindu fundamentalist groups have potentially created recruitment opportunities for Muslim extremists within India .
An amicable resolution of the Kashmir conflict will only help improve peace prospects in South Asia .
For Pakistan , a concerted and sustained effort against all extremist groups operating in the country is necessary .
Militants of all stripes must be decommissioned completely and transparently .
Equally important for Pakistan is to expand and reform its public education system and improve basic services so that radical groups can not lure young people into their educational and welfare networks .
Otherwise , the status quo can gravely threaten Pakistan 's -- and South Asia 's -- future .
The Fight for Pakistan 's Soul
The Fight for Pakistan 's Soul CAMBRIDGE -- As its army confronts , ever more bloodily , the Taliban in the Swat Valley , Pakistan is fighting for its very soul .
The army appears to be winning this time around , in marked contrast to its recent half-hearted confrontations with Taliban forces in neighboring tribal areas .
For now , the Taliban are on the run , some with shaved beards and some in burqas , to avoid being recognized and thrashed .
The reason is simple : increasingly , people across Pakistan support the army 's action .
This support persists despite the terrible humanitarian cost : more than 1.5 million internal refugees .
This round of fighting was preceded by a negotiated calm , as the government sought to quell militants in Pakistan 's tribal areas by striking a deal with the Taliban leader , Sufi Mohammad .
The deal , which instituted a version of Sharia law in the region in exchange for a commitment that militants would lay down their weapons , was blessed by the comparatively liberal Awami National Party -LRB- ANP -RRB- , which governs the North-West Frontier Province -LRB- NWFP -RRB- , where Swat is located .
But the Taliban 's assurances of a lower profile were upended by two incidents that exposed its real face .
First , private news channels broadcast across the country a video clip recorded on a cell phone of the public flogging of a 17-year-old Swat girl .
This gave the public a stark sense of what Taliban justice really meant .
Then , Mohammad was interviewed on GEO TV , where he explained his political views .
According to Mohammad , democracy is un-Islamic , as are Pakistan 's constitution and judiciary , and Islam bars women from getting an education or leaving their homes except to perform the Hajj in Mecca .
Religious conservatives were stunned .
Leaders of the religious parties rushed to denounce Mohammad 's views .
The Pakistani media revisited a famous comment by Mohammad Iqbal , the poet-philosopher who devised the idea of an independent Muslim state in Pakistan .
`` The religion of the mullah , '' he said , `` is anarchy in the name of Allah . ''
Still , it 's not over until it 's over -- and in the short term a lot depends on the state 's capacity to hold the Swat area and re-establish civilian institutions there .
And , even if the state succeeds , re-asserting control over Swat will only be the first step .
The Taliban is spread throughout the NWFP and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas .
`` Punjabi Taliban '' militants from the fighting in Kashmir against India continue to shuttle between the Punjab heartland and the Northwest Territories , posing another serious challenge to government authority .
In the long-term , however , what really matters is whether the Muslims of South Asia will be able to roll back the spread of Talibanization altogether .
The answer to that question lies within the various Muslim communities of the region , not just in Pakistan .
Afghanistan faces an election later this year .
In Pakistan , the democratic transition , after years of military rule , is still not complete .
There is much hope , though , in the vibrancy of the Pakistani media , as well as in the energy that the legal community generated last March in restoring deposed Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry to his seat on the Supreme Court .
Then there is the Pakistani army , the country 's `` super political party . ''
To a large degree , Pakistan 's relations with India , Afghanistan , and the United States depend on the military .
Army commander Ashfaq Kiyani has shown no interest in taking over the state , as his predecessor , General Pervez Musharraf , did .
But the army must accept its subservience to Pakistan 's political leadership .
The army command must finally recognize that repeated military interventions have not served the country well .
Most significantly , in the face of martial law and political assassination , Pakistanis have not given up their dream of democracy .
A living example of this is Afzal Lala , a Pashtun politician associated with the Awami National Party who , despite all the threats from the bloodthirsty Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan , remained in Swat through the recent fighting .
Talibanization gains ground when people lose faith in the capacity of the modern state to improve their lives .
While poor law enforcement needs urgent attention , counter-terrorism is never solely a military affair .
Financial pledges from the US and the `` Friends of Pakistan '' consortium -LRB- the European Union , China , and Japan -RRB- are important , but when it comes to investing wisely in development projects , Pakistan 's track record is nothing to be proud of .
Effective oversight from donors and Pakistan 's private sector will be critical .
Only one condition should be imposed on aid for Pakistan : the first money should be spent on rebuilding all the bombed-out girls ' schools in Swat . If need be , the army should guard these schools around the clock .
Pakistan 's Next Fight
Pakistan 's Next Fight NEW YORK -- The terrorist sanctuary in the South Waziristan region of Pakistan 's tribal frontier with Afghanistan is coming apart .
It took a while for the Pakistani Army to move against the region 's rising violence and chaos , but its campaign in South Waziristan is making progress .
The campaign 's immediate impact consists in Pakistan 's determination to establish its authority in the area .
The terrorists have shown before that they can take a punch , strike back , and even rebuild their networks .
Indeed , even as the Pakistani Army launched operation Rah-e-Nijat -LRB- Path to Salvation -RRB- in October , a dozen devastating terrorist attacks in Pakistan 's major cities demonstrated the reach of the South Waziristan militants .
In a few instances , senior army and intelligence officers were targeted outside their homes in Islamabad , despite extensive security measures in and around the capital .
The October 11 attack on Army Headquarters in Rawalpindi was the most daring of all -- and sent shudders across the military command , because the terrorists knew the layout of the military and security buildings .
But this inside knowledge also worked against the militants , because it demonstrated what was at stake for the country at large .
But success in South Waziristan is only the starting point for dealing with the problem .
Militant hubs are scattered throughout the sparsely-populated tribal areas , including the North Waziristan , Orakzai , and Mohmand regions .
Moreover , violent militancy has now spread into Pakistan proper .
Southern Punjab is seeing a rapid growth in the number of religious fanatics , and rooting out the problem there is much more challenging than acting in the Pashtun tribal areas .
Many militants in Punjab worked closely with the Pakistani intelligence services for years , and their infrastructure is dispersed and hidden in various towns and villages .
The Army , which recruits heavily in the Punjab , will not use force there in the way it is doing in the tribal areas .
Only a concerted law-enforcement effort , with the full support of the intelligence services , can succeed in the Pakistani heartland .
The deep security crisis in Pakistan is mirrored across the border in Afghanistan , which offers a model of what not to do .
The Afghan Taliban , removed from power and routed from the country by the end of 2001 , needed only a few years to revive itself , owing to the failure of the Afghan government and its international backers to rebuild and stabilize the country .
A critical factor in the Taliban 's revival was the haven that it found in the distant reaches of the Pakistan-Afghanistan border , and the support that it continued to receive from elements within Pakistan .
This time , as the Afghan Taliban are expelled from Pakistan , NATO and Afghan forces must be ready to take them on .
Observing the fighting in Pakistan , the United States , Afghanistan , and India expect the Pakistani army to take on both the Afghan Taliban and the Pakistani militants .
But thousands of fighters are thought to be dispersed in the Pashtun tribal areas of Pakistan , with many of them focused on operations in Afghanistan .
The cross-border movement of radicals suggests the importance of international cooperation .
Moreover , alliances among radical groups are constantly shifting , a reflection of tribal traditions and opportunism .
Outsiders watching these shifts , and the Pakistani government 's handling of them , have been unable to discern a consistent pattern that would explain Pakistani policy .
But here , regional politics must be taken into account , especially the continuing rivalry between India and Pakistan .
At every stage of the lengthy conflict that has brought the US into the region , Pakistan has sought to limit Indian influence in Afghanistan .
Indeed , India 's growing influence and investment in Afghanistan is disturbing to Pakistan 's national security apparatus .
Ultimately , the dynamics of Afghan politics will determine Afghanistan 's fate .
But a collaborative India-Pakistan effort to stabilize the country could work wonders .
For both Pakistan and India , Afghanistan risks turning into a new disputed territory , like Kashmir , where conflict has damaged both countries for more than 60 years .
In Afghanistan today , they have an opportunity to reject that precedent and act on their mutual interest in stability .
Pakistan must be able to focus internally on its future .
Financially insolvent and politically paralyzed , Pakistan needs international help to bring development to its liberated tribal areas and hope to the young people -- 65 % of the population -- who live there .
For India , stability in Pakistan and Afghanistan would ease its rise to global economic power .
Both countries should take advantage of the opportunity for cooperation provided by the Pakistani Army 's campaign against Waziristan 's militants .
Is Syria Next ?
Is Syria Next ?
The recent allegation by US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld that Syria is smuggling war materiel into Iraq raises the ominous prospect that America 's attention will turn toward Damascus the moment it is finished with Baghdad .
Rumsfeld 's charge -- vehemently denied by Syria -- now tops a long list of unresolved issues in Syria 's relations with the US : Syria 's open-ended military intervention in Lebanon and continued support of Hezbollah there ; its supposed involvement in the 1982 suicide attack in Beirut that killed 241 US Marines ; its continued support of various `` outlawed '' Palestinian groups ; and its allegedly growing stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons .
Indeed , Syria has long been included on the US State Department 's list of nations that support terrorism .
For these reasons , Syria could well become a potential target for American military adventurism .
Even before the onset of the current hostilities , the possibility was raised by certain members of the Bush Administration , such as Richard Perle , and conservative media commentators , all of whom would gladly add Syria to the `` Axis of Evil . ''
Recognizing this possibility , the Syrian regime has made clear its opposition to the American war in Iraq , which has been branded by President Bashir Assad and other senior officials as `` a war of aggression '' .
Top-level thinking about the risks that Syria runs were recently made clear in an interview that President Assad gave to a Lebanese newspaper .
Assad compared the situations in Lebanon and Iraq , insisting that Iraq could achieve what Lebanon had already accomplished two decades before , namely the forced withdrawal by American and British troops in the face of steadfast , bloody resistance .
`` The US and Britain will not be able to control Iraq , '' Assad claimed .
Declaring that `` Arab popular resistance '' to the American invasion has spread through the region , Assad referred to the increasing numbers of Arab , including Syrian , `` volunteers '' who have gone to Iraq to fight alongside Saddam 's soldiers .
The Arabs , Assad said , would resist American efforts `` to rearrange the region as it sees fit '' in order to control its oil wealth and accommodate Israeli interests .
In response , he called for the enactment of the Arab Mutual Defense Pact .
Recently , the 90-year-old Grand Mufti of Syria , Sheik Ahmad Kiftaro , called on Muslims worldwide to carry out `` martyr operations '' against American interests , a call that could not have been made without advance government approval .
It seems that the Syrian regime is painting itself into a dark and dreary corner , a development that could set the stage for a potential showdown with the US in the not-so-distant future .
This said , however , there is also an unpublicized aspect of Syrian-American relations to consider .
Since the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington on September 11 , 2001 , security cooperation between the two countries seems to have intensified .
The Syrian intelligence apparatus has provided much valuable information on the activities of Muhammad Atta and others suspected of involvement in those attacks , as well as information about other al-Qaeda activities .
There are even indications of some Syrian intelligence-sharing with the Americans regarding Iraqi military readiness in the weeks preceding the attacks .
This should not be surprising , for Syria 's rulers over the last thirty years have proven skillful at hedging their bets .
It is even possible that the regime 's loud anti-American stance might be meant to hide some secret arrangement with the Americans , especially regarding the Kurds and Iraqi opposition members living in Syria .
Nonetheless , if the Americans win in Iraq -- which they must in order to maintain their global credibility as a superpower -- their relations with their new Syrian neighbors will not be easy .
Resolving all outstanding issues will not happen quickly .
Moreover , the Syrian view of the Arab-Israeli dispute can not be glossed over , because Syrian agreement is necessary for any peaceful settlement .
Damascus maintains good political and economic relations with Russia , China , and key EU members , especially France , with its paternalistic attitude towards its former colony and its young president .
On the other hand , with Americans controlling Iraq , Syria will find itself surrounded by three unfriendly -LRB- if not outright hostile -RRB- and allied neighbors : the Americans in the East , and the Turks and Israelis in the north and south , both of which occupy Syrian territories .
Nonetheless , outstanding issues between Syria and the US would be better resolved using smart diplomacy than smart bombs .
Considering the evidence on display in Iraq , Syrian leaders must be wondering whether the Bush administration is capable of thinking in these terms .
At the same time , will Syria 's new rulers prove capable of striking the kind of Machiavellian bargain for which the late Syrian president , Hafiz Al-Assad , was famous ?
But are the Americans willing to see it ?
Cradle of Contradictions
Cradle of Contradictions
The American-led invasion of Iraq was supposed to begin a process of transformation across the Middle East .
Syrian poet and political analyst Ammar Abdulhamid suggests that a thaw - if not quite change , then perhaps its precursor - is now occurring in Syria .
Life in Syria has never been simple .
The realities , meticulously hidden under a veneer of homogeneity , have always been too complex for even the most discerning of scholars .
The peaceful coexistence between the country 's myriad ethnic , religious , and tribal groups is the result of a complex layer of concessions , compromises , tacit agreements , and other pragmatic arrangements perfected over the centuries .
Over the last few months , life has become even more complex , as both the country 's ruling elite and civil society advocates seem more bewildered than ever about the country 's future .
Each group is focused on determining its particular privileges while preserving the territorial integrity and national unity of a country growing increasingly fractious and fragile .
These developments , of course , follow from the US-led invasion of Iraq , which turned a vague and distant threat into an imposing neighbor whose intentions towards Syria 's Baathist regime are anything but friendly .
Consequently , the need for drastic change in the structure and style of a previously reality-impaired regime has finally begun to sink in .
As a result , Syria 's various political power centers have embarked on a desperate search for a vision to promote change yet allow the existing order to survive .
Because Syria 's rulers have neither the ability nor the know-how to produce such a vision , civil society has been granted some leeway for action .
Clearly , this expansion of civil society 's operating arena may even turn into open opposition to Syria 's rulers .
The point is to allow for some debate to take place in the hope of producing the sorely needed vision of change .
This will give the outside world the impression that serious change is taking place and that the regime should be given the time to see it through .
Crackdowns , detentions , and illegal trials thus exist hand in hand with a growing tolerance for creative initiatives .
Over twenty NGOs have been formed in the last few months .
Many are charities and often include on their advisory boards one or two members with clear government connections -LRB- the daughter of a minister or an army general , or , in a couple of notable instances , the President 's wife -RRB- .
Even so , this development is still significant by Syrian standards , as independent initiatives are traditionally frowned upon .
Of real significance here is the press service , All4Syria -LRB- www.all4syria.org -RRB- , created by the Syrian engineer Ayman Abdul Nour .
The service contains an electronic newsletter that includes Syria-related reports and articles gathered from a variety of sources , often including comments by opposition figures at home and abroad .
In its way , All4Syria has provided an indirect conduit for dialogue between government and opposition , which may not have taken place otherwise .
Although All4Syria 's Internet site was recently blocked for unspecified reasons , the newsletter continues to be circulated and Mr. Abdul Nour moves in his usual circles unmolested .
I have been involved with the launch of another initiative , the Tharwa Project -LRB- www.tharwaproject.com -RRB- , which I have long envisioned as one way for the Arab region to address its problems with religious and ethnic minorities .
Although regional in scope and with a colorful international board of advisors , the Tharwa Project -LRB- Tharwa means wealth in Arabic -RRB- is based in Damascus and will be run from there .
The launch of the Tharwa Project one month ago inadvertently coincided with Kurdish riots that rocked northern Syria .
This , together with the prominence of the advisory board -LRB- which includes well-known Egyptian sociologist Saad Eddin Ibrahim , French expert on political Islam Gilles Kepel , and Flynt Leverett , a Brookings Institution Fellow -RRB- and the sensitivity of minority rights in general , combined to give the Project national , regional , and international notice .
So far , Syria 's authorities have not reacted to the Tharwa Project .
But the Project seems to represent the type of activity that can help produce visions for change .
Some in the Syrian government could be aware of this .
Nevertheless , fourteen civil society activists who attempted to organize a special meeting to address the realities of the Kurdish issue in Syria recently received various sentences on charges of working to undermine national unity .
The authorities clearly wish to control the extent of the thaw in Syria 's political culture .
But even as such crackdowns continue , more private independent initiatives are bubbling to the surface .
For my colleagues and me , this is the time for hard and continuous work to expand the space of popular participation in the country and region .
We can deliver no judgment at this stage as to where things might be heading .
Everything and anything seems possible .
Still , it is tempting to think that Syria is witnessing a new beginning , and the end of an era whose sins we all bear .
Is Dialogue with Iran and Syria Worth It ?
Is Dialogue with Iran and Syria Worth It ?
Despite frequent claims to the contrary , the fundamental problem in the Middle East is not intervention by the West .
This leaves everyone in the region at the mercy of the Middle East 's oppressive regimes and proliferating terrorists .
Advocates of the Iraq war lacked an understanding of the complexities on the ground to wage an effective war of liberation and democratization .
As a result , their policies merely ended up eliminating Iran 's two major regional rivals : the Taliban and Saddam Hussein 's regime . This presented Iran with a golden opportunity to project itself as a regional hegemon , and Iran 's leaders are unlikely to let this opportunity slip away .
Advocates of dialogue with the Iranians and their Syrian allies , like former United States Secretary of State James Baker , labor under the delusion that they can actually reach an understanding that can enable a graceful US exit from Iraq and help stabilize that wounded country .
The delusion is based on two false assumptions : that the Iranians and the Syrians can succeed in Iraq where the US has failed , and that the international community can afford to pay the price of ensuring their cooperation .
True , Syria and Iran are playing a major role in supporting Iraqi insurgents , and Syria is still encouraging the trafficking of jihadists and weapons across its borders with Iraq .
But the idea that these activities can be halted at will is naïve .
For one thing , the interests of the Shia communities in Iraq and Iran are not the same .
Iraqi Shia have never accepted Iranian dictates , and many took part in Saddam 's war against Iran in the 1980 's .
After all , the Iraqi Shia are Arabs , and if they are now willing to coordinate their activities with their Persian counterparts , their main goal will always be to secure an independent course as soon as possible , even while they carry on with their internecine disputes within Iraq .
Iran is in no better position than the US to convince them to resolve their differences .
President Basher al-Assad of Syria faces a similar dilemma .
Although he has opened Syria 's border to jihadists and has allowed Saddam 's supporters to operate freely there , that choice may not be entirely his .
Syria 's aid to Saddam in maneuvering around the United Nations ' oil-for food program brought Iraqi money to inhabitants of the border region , who have always been closer in customs , dialect , and outlook to their Iraqi neighbors than to their fellow Syrians .
In the absence of government investment , local inhabitants ' loyalty went to Iraqi Baathists who helped improve their lot .
Indeed , even local security apparatuses have been unwilling to comply with dictates from Assad and his clique to seal the borders .
In these cirumstances , neither Syria nor Iran seems capable of delivering anything but mayhem in Iraq .
What , then , would the proposed dialogue between the US and these states achieve other than continue to empower their corrupt yet ambitious regimes ?
The story gets more complicated when one considers the UN inquiry into the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri .
Assad wants nothing more than to see this affair forgotten -- and the proponents of dialogue think that they can give him what he wants in the hope of breaking Syria 's alliance with Iran .
But that is merely another erroneous -LRB- not to mention amoral -RRB- assumption .
The alliance between Syria and Iran dates back more than two decades , and was explicitly reaffirmed by the two ruling regimes as recently as January 2005 .
In fact , Iran has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in Syria , and annual bilateral trade tops a billion dollars .
Irani 's growing influence over the Syrian security apparatus is well established , and Iran is funding an effort to create Syrian Shia militias to compensate for Assad 's sagging support in the army and in the minority Alawite community .
Assad can not turn his back on all of this .
No deal would be sweet enough , even if it included the return of the Golan Heights .
For Assad and his supporters , survival is more important than sovereignty .
Still , to read the well-known names of commentators and policymakers who are recommending engaging Syria and\/or Iran is a testament to how inconsequential and cut off the Western powers have become from the realities on the ground in the world 's most turbulent region .
That , it seems , is the price of their arrogance .
Gaza 's Crushed Childhoods
Gaza 's Crushed Childhoods AMMAN &#45; &#45; Ayman is a soft-spoken 14-year-old boy in Jabalia City , Gaza .
His family is poor , and his parents have already sold almost all their furniture to pay for food and schooling for their children .
Recently , after collecting a government food handout , Ayman 's father , who has been unemployed since March 2006 , had to sell the milk to pay for the journey back home .
Ayman , his siblings , and all Gaza 's children are finding their lives diminished each day -- a cruel , slow suffocation of their spirit and their dreams .
Instead of enjoying expanding horizons , they are trapped in a virtual prison , where things that every child should be able to take for granted are instead being taken away : the right to play , to go to school , to have enough to eat , to have light to study by at night , and to feel safe in their own homes .
The weight of one of the world 's longest-running conflicts is resting on their thin shoulders , crushing their childhood and inflicting psychological scars that may never heal .
Almost 2,000 children in Gaza have dropped out of school in the last five months . Those who remain must share tattered textbooks and do without crucial resources .
The January 2008 semester exams at schools in Gaza operated by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East -LRB- UNRWA -RRB- found 50-60 % failure rates in mathematics and a 40 % failure rate in Arabic -- the children 's native language . Despite this , Ayman insists , `` I want to be an educated person . I want to be an engineer to build my country . ''
Water and sewage systems are failing ; garbage is piling up in the streets .
UNICEF is working around the clock to restore a sense of normalcy for Gaza 's youth -- developing remedial worksheets to help children keep up with their studies ; creating sports and recreation programs in schools ; and working with communities to establish play areas where kids can be kids in safety .
UNICEF works with partners to get water , hygiene , and medical supplies to households and health facilities .
But , while UNICEF is doing all it can to comfort those in the midst of Gaza 's madness , only political leaders can bring the dreadful nightmare to an end . It is time for new engagement . The siege must be lifted .
The killing of civilians has to stop , on both sides .
Palestinian and Israeli children deserve to grow up in peace . And leaders on both sides , supported by the international community , must join in the kind of honest dialogue that is the only viable path toward achieving it .
Ayman 's father quietly says , `` My children are my hope . '' The children of Gaza are a light in the darkness . They deserve a chance to shine .
The Root of All Sovereign-Debt Crises
NEW YORK -- The Greek debt crisis has prompted questions about whether the euro can survive without a nearly unimaginable centralization of fiscal policy .
There is a simpler way .
Irresponsible borrowing by governments in international credit markets requires irresponsible lending .
Bank regulators should just say no to such lending by institutions that are already under their purview .
Lending to foreign governments is in many ways inherently riskier than unsecured private debt or junk bonds .
Private borrowers often have to offer collateral , such as their houses .
The collateral limits the lenders ' downside risk , and the fear of losing the pledged assets encourages borrowers to act prudently .
But governments offer no collateral , and their principal incentive to repay -- the fear of being cut off by international credit markets -- derives from a perverse addiction .
Only governments that are chronically unable to finance their outlays with domestic taxes or domestic debt must keep borrowing large sums abroad .
A deep craving for the favor of foreign lenders usually derives from some deeply engrained form of misgoverance .
Commercial debt usually has covenants that limit the borrower 's ability to roll the dice .
Loan or bond covenants often require borrowers to agree to maintain a minimum level of equity capital or cash on hand .
Government bonds , on the other hand , have no covenants .
Similarly , private borrowers can go to prison if they misrepresent their financial condition to secure bank loans .
Securities laws require that issuers of corporate bonds spell out all possible risks .
By contrast , governments pay no penalties for outrageous misrepresentation or fraudulent accounting , as the Greek debacle shows .
When private borrowers default , bankruptcy courts supervise a bankruptcy or reorganization process through which even unsecured creditors can hope to recover something .
But there is no process for winding up a state and no legal venue for renegotiating its debts .
Worse , the debt that states raise abroad is usually denominated in a currency whose value they can not control .
So a gradual , invisible reduction in the debt burden by debasing the currency is rarely an option .
The power to tax is thought to make government debt safer : private borrowers have no right to the profits or wages that they need to satisfy their obligations .
But the power to tax has practical limits , and governments ' moral or legal right to bind future generations of citizens to repay foreign creditors is questionable .
Lending to states thus involves unfathomable risks that ought to be borne by specialized players who are willing to live with the consequences .
Historically , sovereign lending was a job for a few intrepid financiers , who drove shrewd bargains and were adept at statecraft .
Lending to governments against the collateral of a port or railroad -- or the use of military force to secure repayment -- was not unknown .
After the 1970 's , though , sovereign lending became institutionalized .
Citibank -- whose chief executive , Walter Wriston , famously declared that countries do n't go bust -- led the charge , recycling a flood of petrodollars to dubious regimes .
It was more lucrative business than traditional lending : a few bankers could lend enormous sums with little due diligence -- except for the small detail that governments plied with easy credit do sometimes default .
Later , the Basel accords whetted banks ' appetite for more government bonds by ruling them virtually risk-free .
Banks loaded up on the relatively high-yield debt of countries like Greece because they had to set aside very little capital .
But , while the debt was highly rated , how could anyone objectively assess unsecured and virtually unenforceable obligations ?
Bank lending to sovereign borrowers has been a double disaster , fostering over-indebtedness , especially in countries with irresponsible or corrupt governments .
And , because much of the risk is borne by banks -LRB- rather than by , say , hedge funds -RRB- , which play a central role in lubricating the payments system , a sovereign-debt crisis can cause widespread harm .
The Greek debacle jeopardized the well-being of all of Europe , not only Greeks .
The solution to breaking the nexus between sovereign-debt crises and banking crises is straightforward : limit banks to lending where evaluation of borrowers ' willingness and ability to repay is n't a great leap in the dark .
This means no cross-border sovereign debt -LRB- or esoteric instruments , such as collateralized debt obligations -RRB- .
This simple rule would require no complex reordering of European fiscal arrangements , nor would it require the creation of new supra-national entities .
It would certainly make it difficult for governments to borrow abroad , but that would be a good outcome for their citizens , not an imposition .
Moreover , curtailing governments ' access to international credit -LRB- and , by extension , inducing more fiscal responsibility -RRB- could actually help more enterprising and productive borrowers .
Such constraints would n't solve the current crisis in Portugal , Ireland , Greece , or Spain .
But it is high time that Europe , and the world , stopped lurching from one short-term fix to the next and addressed the real structural issues .
Europe 's Second Chance in the Balkans
Europe 's Second Chance in the Balkans Confronting the disintegration of Yugoslavia in 1991 , former EU Council President Jacques Poos made his famous but now derided statement : `` This is the hour of Europe ... not the hour of the Americans . ''
What the EU learned from the subsequent four years of Balkan disasters under its management is now being tested by another major turning point and potential crisis -- when and how Kosovo is to become independent .
Once again , Europe 's role may well prove decisive .
The decision on Kosovo may not imply the prospect of renewed large-scale conflict , but it does raise serious questions for Europe 's relations with Russia and the United States , as well as for stability throughout the Balkans .
While the US has a major stake in the outcome , EU countries obviously have the most significant interests in the region , and perhaps this time they will assume a corresponding leadership role .
For at least the next two months , the United Nations Security Council will debate a blueprint for Kosovo 's future , arduously worked out during a year of `` negotiations '' between the governments in Belgrade and Pristina by UN envoy and former Finnish president Martti Ahtisaari .
The bluebrint provides for Kosovo 's `` supervised independence , '' maximum protection for Serb and other minorities , and a supervisory role for the EU .
Ahtisaari 's proposal is an acknowledgement that no agreement between the parties is possible , and that there is no constructive alternative to Kosovo 's independence .
Together with the US , the EU collectively has rallied around the Ahtisaari proposal .
But individually , a number of European countries -- Spain , Greece , Italy , Cyprus , Romania , Slovakia , and Austria -- are skeptical or negative toward Kosovo independence , which raises profound questions about the EU 's resolve .
Meanwhile , Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica is waging a tireless and remarkably effective diplomatic campaign denouncing both Ahtisaari and his proposal .
He has strengthened the position of many in Europe and elsewhere who are skeptical of challenging a country 's territorial integrity or who still claim to believe in a negotiated settlement .
More worrisome is the current uncertainty about whether a shaky Europe will stand up to Russia , upon which Serbia depends to maintain sovereignty over Kosovo .
So far , the Kremlin has resolutely stated that it will accept only a settlement agreed to by both parties , in effect endorsing Serbia 's position .
While conveying the possibility of a veto , Russia 's current strategy is to delay a Security Council vote as long as possible by prompting a new fact-finding mission to Kosovo , which will most likely be followed by renewed insistence on another effort to negotiate a settlement .
Serbia welcomes delay in the hope that this will stimulate violence by frustrated Kosovars , thereby increasing Europe 's opposition to independence and bolstering Serbia 's dedication to maintaining the status quo , or , as a last resort , to partitioning Kosovo .
Some European countries apparently believe that they can maintain an EU consensus in support of Ahtisaari 's plan but allow Russian foot-dragging on the grounds that delay is not unreasonable and something better may turn up with additional negotiations .
But , by adopting such a stance , they thwart their own envoy and may well stimulate the violence they profess to abhor .
History offers little consolation .
The EU 's handling of relations with Serbia in the past only encouraged intransigence .
Instead of repeatedly making clear that Kosovo independence is an indispensable requirement for EU membership -- so important to Serbia 's modernization and Balkan stability -- EU leaders like Javier Solana laud Kostunica as a great democratic leader .
They relentlessly but unsuccessfully pressured Montenegro 's leaders to remain in a dysfunctional union with Serbia , condoned Kostunica 's dubious 2006 referendum on a new constitution enshrining Kosovo as a part of Serbia , and weakened demands for Serbia 's cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague .
Realizing Ahtisaari 's proposal will depend on EU solidarity and persistence , coupled with strong American support , to manage the vicissitudes of UN debate , lobby skeptical non-permanent Security Council members , such as Indonesia and South Africa , and persuade Russia to abstain rather than exercise its veto .
Many believe that Russia will not risk its relations with Europe and the US , ultimately abstaining if Western countries hold firm .
But Russia appears to be in a Gaullist mood , and has other outstanding issues causing friction with the US and Europe .
Putin 's Russia is not Yeltsin 's Russia , when the West could simply shunt aside Russian concerns .
Europe is vulnerable on many fronts , particularly in view of its dependence on Russian energy , while America 's weakened presidency has diminished US influence in Russia .
If Russia does veto the Ahtisaari plan , the EU 's united facade will likely fracture , with many European countries refusing either to join the US in recognizing an independent Kosovo without the UN 's blessing or to send a supervisory mission there .
That would open a new and tumultuous era in the Balkans , with more than Kosovo at stake .
Indeed , with the UN and the Western alliance in disarray , the region could fall victim to further Russian policy mischief .
Putin 's Balkan Mischief Russia is again on a tear .
This time , the Kremlin has stuck its finger in the West 's eye over the long and painful effort to bring Kosovo to formal independence .
Unlike the fracas over an American missile shield in Europe , this conflict shows no signs of blowing over , and threatens to damage further the rocky relationship between Russia and the West .
At every turn , Russia has challenged Western efforts to facilitate Kosovo 's independence . After a year of negotiations between Serbia and Kosovo , President Vladimir Putin 's Kremlin rejected the UN mediator 's report recommending supervised independence , prevented the Security Council from accepting that report , and insisted on three additional months of negotiations between Serbia and Kosovo -- even after compromise became impossible .
Three weeks ago in the UN Security Council , Russia again insisted that any agreement required the approval of both Serbia and Kosovo , and that further negotiations were necessary .
Russia knows that such negotiations will be fruitless , but believes that another seemingly innocent appeal for more talks would strain EU unity , which appears to be a vital goal for Putin .
Further delay might also generate violence in Kosovo and undermine international support for independence .
Putin 's hatred of the Yeltsin era 's `` subservient '' relations with the West fuels his opposition .
But the West 's delay in resolving Kosovo 's status permitted that opposition to gain traction .
Indeed , the West has consistently misread Russia 's intentions on Kosovo .
Many claimed that the Kremlin was delaying the inevitable but ultimately would not block independence .
Now , at the eleventh hour , Russia is sticking to its obstructionist position , and its presidential election in March will likely reinforce anti-Western postures .
So what will Putin do when the United States and most European Union members recognize an independent Kosovo in the coming months without a UN blessing , as they now plan ?
It is unlikely that the Kremlin would attempt another military intervention in Kosovo -LRB- their effort in 1999 to land troops at Pristina airport was a fiasco -RRB- , but it has a range of options that must give the West pause .
Kremlin support has made Serbia 's nationalist intransigence over Kosovo effective .
Russia has said that it will not give Serbia a blank check , but it will likely support the Serbian government 's efforts to isolate and destabilize an independent Kosovo .
While Serbia has resisted partition of Kosovo , Russia would also support a Serbian proposal to partition the Serb-populated north , an effort that would open up a Pandora 's box of possible partition of Serbia , Bosnia , and Macedonia .
Such a proposal could get some support in Europe and elsewhere as a seemingly appropriate compromise , even if it would destabilize the Balkans once more .
Russia will certainly continue its diplomatic efforts to persuade the world that negotiations are the only way to solve the problem , and that it can not be solved outside the UN .
That will attract support among many UN members , including those that have major dissatisfied ethnic minorities .
Russia could also react beyond the Balkans , most obviously in the Caucasus , with its breakaway regions , particularly in Georgia .
A declaration of independence by Kosovo will likely bring a similar declaration from Georgia 's breakaway Abkhazia region , which Russia could well recognize .
If Georgia takes military steps to prevent that , Russia 's military would likely react with force , creating a situation that could get out of control .
While the US and the EU do not want to worsen relations with Russia , they can not retreat in the face of Russian obduracy ; security in Europe is at stake .
But they must also continue to try to preempt confrontation with Russia on all fronts .
The West should make clear to Serbia that it will react vigorously against any efforts to promote violence or partition Kosovo .
Dispatching additional NATO troops , in addition to the planned EU mission , to supervise Kosovo independence would be helpful .
Putin 's Russia , which pays little attention to the rule of law , cloaks its diplomatic effort in the guise of adherence to international law , in particular UN Security Council resolution 1244 , which ended the 1999 Kosovo war .
A long overdue diplomatic offensive needs to be launched to undercut Russian arguments as well as remind the world of what happened in Kosovo .
Resolution 1244 does not state that Kosovo must remain under Serb sovereignty , as Russia and Serbia insist , nor does it preclude independence .
Indeed , any reasonable reading of the resolution -- especially in the context of the conflict-ridden Balkans over the past two decades -- would acknowledge that independence would satisfy the resolution 's intent and the purpose of sustaining UN supervision of the province for the past eight years .
In the case of Abkhazia , the West should reiterate the sui generis nature of Kosovo and highlight the tremendous efforts it has undertaken there since 1999 .
The world must make clear that Russian military involvement in Abkhazia is unacceptable , while also restraining Georgia 's government from reacting militarily to any provocation .
How Russia reacts to Western support of Kosovo 's coming declaration of independence will test how far we have progressed since the Cold War .
Through careful management of Kosovo 's independence process , and attentiveness to opportunities to improve relations with Russia , the West might mitigate the worst consequences of this confrontation .
Palestine 's War of Generations
Palestine 's War of Generations
Yasir Arafat may be dead , but his Machiavellian strategies linger .
Ever protective of his position as sole leader of the Palestinian people , Arafat sought to block any means by which a potential rival could challenge him .
But in protecting his position , Arafat also blocked the appointment of a successor in his lifetime .
In the first weeks after Arafat 's death , that seemed not to matter .
Mahmoud Abbas , Arafat 's longtime deputy and the architect of the Oslo accords , quickly secured the backing of Fatah , the PLO 's core body .
A seamless transition appeared possible .
But now Marwan Barghouti , Fatah 's leader in the West Bank during the current Intifada , has decided to contest Abbas for the presidency of the Palestinian Authority -LRB- PA -RRB- from his Israeli jail cell .
Facing economic stagnation and what Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Ahmed Qurei calls `` the anarchy of weapons , '' a succession struggle is the last thing Palestinians need .
Any new leader must spur the economy , enforce the rule of law , fight corruption , unify the PA 's security agencies , and preserve public safety -- and he must do so quickly or lose authority .
Abbas -LRB- also known as Abu Mazen -RRB- represents the Old Guard of Palestinian politics .
But the Young Guard -- those who led the first Intifada -LRB- 1987-1993 -RRB- , as well as those making their names in the current Intifada -- want a share of power .
Abbas will thus need to find support within this rising generation of nationalist leaders if he is to succeed .
Resolving this generational struggle peacefully will require democratic elections within Fatah for membership of both the Revolutionary Council and the Central Committee .
The Sixth Fatah Congress , the first in sixteen years , will take place in August 2005 and will seek to reconcile the conflict between the Old and Young Guard .
Unlike Arafat and his fellow exiles , Barghouti , the most prominent leader among the Young Guard , grew up under Israeli occupation , and was arrested and detained several times .
Barghouti 's popularity also stems from his refusal from the beginning to take any office in Arafat 's corrupt PA and its institutions .
But Barghouti has begun speaking out from his jail cell on the political situation , and his presence is growing .
His decision to challenge Abbas means that the `` secular '' forces within the Palestinian movement may be divided at a time when rivals with a robust Islamic agenda -- principally Hamas and Islamic Jihad -- are challenging them .
Both Hamas and Islamic Jihad are highly disciplined organizations , exercising tight control over their political and military wings .
Although Hamas has been weakened by Israel 's targeted assassinations of Sheik Ahmad Yassin and Abdel-Aziz Rantisi , it retains strong military capabilities and popular support ranging between 25-30 % , making it the second leading faction in the West Bank and Gaza .
Hamas has declared that it will not nominate its own candidate for the PA presidency .
Hassan Yusuf , a Hamas leader who was recently released from an Israeli jail after 28 months of administrative internment , explained to Al-Jazeera that `` if Hamas assumed the leadership at this time , it would be vilified and isolated by the international community , and then the people would suffer . ''
Although Hamas is boycotting the election , many Hamas sympathizers will vote for the candidate most committed to defending the Palestinians ' core demands .
Here Hamas members are simply reiterating Arafat 's views , which will continue to limit the concessions any new leader can make .
Arafat set forth a blueprint including an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza , with East Jerusalem as its capital , and a fair and just solution to the refugee problem .
Changing leaders will in no way alter these conditions for making peace .
So the question is this : who will Palestinians , in particular the Hamas constituency , think is better able to secure these goals , Abbas or Barghouti ?
That answer will most likely determine who will be the PA 's next leader .
But in the end , Israel will also have to make a choice , because peace will require Israeli concessions , not just compromises from the Palestinians .
Israel must freeze its settlement activity in the West Bank and stop constructing its barrier wall on Palestinian territories .
Israel must also free Palestinian prisoners , remove all checkpoints between Palestinian villages and town , and redeploy its forces to positions held prior to September 28 , 2000 , in accordance with phase I of the Road Map .
Either Abbas or Barghouti would certainly meet such a demonstration of good faith with good faith of his own .
The Hour of Hamas
The Hour of Hamas Israel 's unilateral withdrawal from all 21 Gaza settlements and four in the West Bank has created a new reality for Palestinians .
How the Palestinians choose to respond to these changed circumstances may well determine whether or not they at last achieve an independent state .
So this moment may prove to be the Palestinians ' greatest opportunity .
Or , in the words of Abba Eban , it may be yet another opportunity to miss an opportunity . How the Palestinians respond depends largely on how the Palestinian body politic deals with the growing power of Palestinian Islamic movements , which undoubtedly expect a significant share of power in post-withdrawal Gaza . Will armed groups resume their fight against Israel , or will the Palestinian Authority act to defuse or combat the attacks ?
To what degree are Fatah , the secular movement controlled by Palestine President Abbas , and the Islamist Hamas ready to reach an understanding about how to proceed after the disengagement ?
Abbas and other PA officials stress the need for `` one regime , one legal system , and political pluralism . ''
Abbas also wants weapons in only one set of hands -- those of the Palestinian Authority .
He successfully persuaded Palestinian militants to hold their fire and show Israelis and the world that dismantling settlements need not involve Israeli-Palestinian violence .
But can he translate this achievement into an extended ceasefire , peaceful elections , and consolidated PA rule in Gaza and the northern West Bank ? Failure to do so will lead to yet another defeat for the legitimate Palestinian aim of attaining a viable state .
The diffculty of the task ahead can hardly be overstated .
Hamas has launched an intensive media campaign to appropriate the Israeli withdrawal as a victory of its `` armed struggle . ''
The campaign and its themes reflect an internal fight for control of the Gaza Strip and other PA-administered territories , and stresses Hamas ' determination not to be disarmed and to continue the `` armed struggle '' in the West Bank .
Hamas also revealed two `` military secrets '' during the evacuation .
The first is a new missile named Sajil , which has a range of 15 kilometers and can reach more Israeli towns and cities .
The second is the `` Qassamits , '' young women who are engaged in combat training .
Hamas timed these revelations with the disengagement to create the impression that its intensifying military strategy had prevailed .
According to one Hamas slogan in the streets of Gaza during the Israeli withdrawal , `` Four years of sacrifices weigh more than ten years of negotiations . ''
Similarly , Mohamed Deif , the leader of Hamas 's military wing , asserted on a recent videotape that the lesson of Gaza is that Israel can be forced out of the West Bank , Jerusalem , and Haifa .
All of this is designed to reinforce one point : the Gaza withdrawal belongs to Hamas .
A survey published on a Web site associated with Hamas claimed credit for killing 54 % of all the Israelis who died as a result of Palestinians ' armed struggle , and this body count is Hamas 's claim to success .
In these circumstances , who will administer the evacuated areas until elections are held ?
How will tax revenues be divided between those who claim leadership of the resistance and those who claim exclusive legitimacy to govern ?
These are not problems that can await resolution . Someone must decide soon , for example , about the division of the land and the apartments to be built in what is already known as `` Khalifa bin Zaid City , '' located on a former Israeli settlement in the Gaza Strip .
There is no answer yet to any of these questions .
Whereas Hamas has demanded establishment of a Palestinian administration to supervise the areas vacated by Israel , Abbas has rejected this , agreeing at most to a `` monitoring committee '' in which representatives of Hamas will participate .
In any case , there will be no `` division of areas '' until Israel withdraws completely and the ruins are cleared away .
Then the bitter political struggle will begin in advance of the elections .
No matter what happens the day after Israel 's final Gaza disengagement , one can not escape the fact that Hamas 's military options have diminished greatly .
Construction of the separation wall on the West Bank has made it almost impossible for Hamas fighters to reach Israel proper .
In addition , after the reoccupation of the West Bank 's cities in April 2002 , Israel arrested about 7000 Palestinians who are allegedly associated with Hamas , Fatah , and other Palestinian groups .
Continued armed struggle by Hamas will not be easy .
Hamas knows this , and thus is focusing its attention on the Gaza disengagement , seeking to exploit this victory by demanding a share in the post-disengagement order .
It has agreed to participate , for the first time , in the election of the Palestinian Legislative Council , which is due in January 2006 , and it is expected to win a large number of seats .
This would , of course , cement its central role in Palestinian politics -- and it would just as surely exacerbate the challenge facing Abbas .
The Hamas Earthquake
Hamas 's crushing defeat of Fatah in this week 's elections brings the Palestinian people to a crossroads .
An Islamist political party that previously abstained from national politics and rejects Fatah 's policy of negotiations with Israel , is now in charge in Palestine .
Hamas won 76 of 132 seats in the Palestinian Legislative Council , and can count on support from four independent deputies .
Overall , that 's 60 % of the seats in Parliament , won in nearly every district in the West Bank and Gaza .
Hamas entered electoral politics only recently , but its massive victory was preceded by wide success in municipal elections .
Hamas 's political moment has come .
Under Palestinian law , Mahmoud Abbas , the Palestinian president , must now ask Hamas to form a new government .
For their part , Fatah officials seem unwilling to join a Hamas-led government .
Although Hamas has said that it would seek such a coalition , Fatah 's humiliating defeat has left it with little credibility as a governing partner .
So far , Fatah 's senior leaders have declared that they will be a loyal opposition in Parliament , leaving governmental responsibility to Hamas .
Instead , they will have to focus on rebuilding and reenergizing Fatah .
Hamas is well aware of the shock that its victory has produced .
If Fatah refuses to join a coalition , Hamas may opt for a government of independents and technocrats .
It is unlikely that Hamas will form a government composed of hardliners .
The political , security , and economic circumstances of the Palestinians require a government focused on solving problems , not ideological purity .
The most urgent challenge facing the new government is rampant lawlessness and anarchy throughout Palestinian society .
Murder , kidnapping , and extortion have reached record heights .
Armed individuals resort to kidnapping to get jobs , free family members from prison , and exact revenge .
Often , the people involved in these crimes belong to local gangs or even to the militias of large clans .
In opposition , Hamas adamantly refused to collect illegal weapons .
Now , it will have to deal with a Palestinian society that is armed to the teeth , with poverty rates reaching 70 % and unemployment at 35 % .
Having benefited from overwhelming political rejection of Fatah , Hamas will now be judged by how it uses its new authority .
For the first time , a political clock is ticking for Hamas .
Senior Hamas officials are well aware of the challenge , and have promised a complete overhaul of Palestinian public services and administration .
More than anything else , Hamas 's success in the coming months will be measured by its response to these issues .
Will Hamas be able to root out corruption and incompetence , and deliver services fairly and efficiently ?
How will its election affect Palestine 's foreign aid inflows , which form major component of the national budget ?
Initial international reaction to the Hamas victory has been severe .
The Bush administration has declared that it will not deal with a Hamas government , because Hamas remains committed to Israel 's destruction .
This , indeed , is the language of Hamas 's 1988 covenant .
Interestingly , however , Hamas 's election platform combined different approaches to the issue of a Palestinian state .
On the one hand , Hamas agreed for the first time to the establishment of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza , with East Jerusalem as its capital . On the other hand , the platform repeats Hamas 's refusal to relinquish even an inch of historic Palestine .
Whether Hamas can actually be transformed into a more moderate organization is impossible to say right now .
But it is clear that Hamas is now vulnerable to public opinion and , as a governing authority , will have to deal with the international response to its victory .
Immediately after the election , a senior Hamas official , Mahmoud al-Zahar , said that Hamas would maintain the cease-fire with Israel begun last February , if Israel did the same . Hamas may be signaling that it will not provoke Israel .
Perhaps its governing responsibilities will push Hamas toward ongoing discussions with the United States and the international community .
In any case , despite the election results , and even without Fatah in government , Abbas remains in charge of negotiations with Israel .
He has quickly called for a revival of peace talks , although Israel , like the US , has refused to deal with Hamas .
Palestinians have entered uncharted waters .
They turned out in droves to vote in an election that former US President Jimmy Carter described as honest , fair and unmarked by violence .
They elected a party which called for `` reform and change '' in response to a decade of violence and lawlessness .
And Palestinians accepted Hamas 's view that negotiations based on the Oslo Accords could not achieve Palestinian rights and political ambitions .
Victory achieved , Hamas will take on the responsibility for the Palestinian side in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict .
With the Palestinians ' future at stake -- not to mention the future of Israel and the Middle East -- no one can say if Hamas is up to the task .
Hamas and Fatah at the Crossroads
Hamas and Fatah at the Crossroads Palestinian politics is approaching the point of no return .
The power struggle between the Islamist Hamas and Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas and his secular\/nationalist Fatah movement is intensifying , with tensions breaking into outright combat .
Since Hamas was founded in the early 1980 's , it has refused to come under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization -LRB- PLO -RRB- .
Hamas 's victory in the parliamentary election earlier this year -- a democratic watershed -- demonstrated that it had come of age politically .
For the first time in Palestinian history , a religious party is dominant .
But Fatah has not accepted defeat , while Hamas is convinced that elements within Fatah agree with Israeli and American plans to topple the Hamas government .
Abbas remains the Palestinian president , and the Basic Law makes him commander of all Palestinian security forces .
However , while most official security forces remain loyal to him , over the past year Hamas has created an alternative security structure , built around a 4000-member `` Operational Force . ''
Moreover , Hamas has announced plans to recruit 1,500 additional security personnel for the West Bank , Fatah 's stronghold .
In recent weeks , the two sides have clashed frequently across the Gaza strip , heightening tensions further .
The confrontations have come at a time when Abbas has been trying to persuade Hamas to moderate its anti-Israel stance and ally with Fatah in a national unity government .
Abbas believes that Hamas 's acceptance of negotiations with Israel is the only way to break the international sanctions that are devastating Palestinian society .
Despite this , both sides are building up their forces .
Intelligence reports suggest that Hamas is smuggling weapons and explosives from the Sinai into the Gaza Strip at an accelerated pace .
The United States , Israel , and some Arab governments plan to arm and train forces loyal to Abbas , especially his presidential guard . They want to prepare Abbas 's forces in Gaza for a confrontation with Hamas , which they believe is inevitable .
Israel is considering Abbas 's request to transfer arms and ammunitions from Egypt and Jordan in hopes of bolstering his loyalist forces .
There is also an American proposal to allow the Badr Brigade -- a wing of the Palestine Liberation Army that is currently stationed in Jordan -- to relocate to the Palestinian territories as Abbas 's rapid reaction force in Gaza in anticipation of a feared civil war .
The Badr Brigade is composed of several thousand Palestinians , mostly long-time PLO activists .
As the maneuvering continues , Israel and Egypt find themselves working together to bolster Abbas and Fatah .
With the Gaza Strip in its backyard , Egypt has already mediated several times between Hamas and Fatah , and has been trying , so far unsuccessfully , to arrange a swap of prisoners with Israel following Hamas 's abduction of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit .
But Egypt 's government is angry with Hamas for opposing the formation of a coalition government .
Indeed , the seizure of Shalit deepened the rift between Hamas and Fatah , which believes that the abduction was staged in order to sabotage discussions about a national unity government .
More generally , Egypt is concerned that Gaza is becoming politically radicalized and may be transformed into `` Hamastan . ''
This , Egypt fears , would give a boost to its own Islamic radicals , against which the government has long fought .
Egypt also worries about a possible Hamas-Fatah civil war .
Although Hamas has ruled this out , it has shown no hesitation to use heavy force against its opponents .
Likewise , Foreign Minister Mahmoud Al-Zahar of the Hamas-led government says that any dissolution of the government or call for early elections by Abbas would be a recipe for civil war .
Fear of major fighting has already sent many Palestinians into Egypt , leading to the deployment of Egyptian troops on the border to control any mass exodus .
Israel , meanwhile , is worried that Hamas has strengthened its military grip on Gaza , in terms of both fortifications and networks capable of launching Qassam rockets into neighboring Israeli towns .
Israel might not wait for Abbas and his forces , but rather launch a full-scale intervention to weaken Hamas .
Can Hamas and Fatah put aside their differences and form a unity government ?
Abbas says that if a coalition government is not agreed upon within the next two weeks , he will dissolve the current government , a move Hamas will not tolerate .
But forming a coalition government is unlikely to ease the tension between Hamas and Fatah .
New confrontations would likely emerge as soon as a new government was formed .
Ironically , the most likely way to avoid large-scale confrontation between Fatah and Hamas is through an Israeli incursion into Gaza .
Facing the Israelis together is the only way that the rival Palestinian groups will postpone their own bloody showdown .
Palestine 's House Divided
Palestine 's House Divided President George W. Bush 's call for a new peace conference for Israel , Palestine , and neighboring states that back a two-state solution is a welcome , if very tardy , development .
But efforts to re-start the peace process now confront a stark new reality : two mutually hostile Palestinian entities in Hamas-ruled Gaza and the Fatah-led West Bank must now be factored into the process .
The Hamas\/Fatah face-off marks a dramatic shift in Palestinian politics , whose top priorities until now has been an end to the Israeli occupation and the establishment of an independent state .
It also tremendously complicates peace negotiations , which both the Palestinians and the `` Quartet '' -LRB- the United States , the European Union , the United Nations , and Russia -RRB- had premised on maintaining the Gaza Strip and the West Bank as a single territorial unit .
Ironically , these territories were reunited by Israel 's victory in the 1967 war , after 19 years of separation .
Previously , Egypt had ruled in Gaza , while Jordan annexed the West Bank .
Under Israel 's occupation , and then with the establishment of the Palestinian Authority -LRB- PA -RRB- in 1994 , the territories remained separated geographically , but not politically .
The Hamas takeover in Gaza has -- at least for now -- ended that political unification .
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has now set his conditions for dialogue .
Hamas must withdraw its armed men from all security headquarters they occupied , return power to the legitimate authority , and apologize to the Palestinian people .
Although internal division harms Palestinians ' national interest , it is unlikely amid mutual accusations and incitements that dialogue between Fatah and Hamas will be conducted soon .
But the fear that is most consuming Abbas and Fatah is that the conflict with Hamas might spread to the West Bank .
To avoid such a scenario , Abbas has banned all militias and military groups in the West Bank , including his Fatah Party 's al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades .
Abbas has succeeded in convincing Israel to grant amnesty to many Fatah fugitives in the West Bank who will join his security apparatuses .
Abbas has also asked Israel to allow the PLO 's Badr Brigade , currently stationed in Jordan , to enter the West Bank .
That would give Abbas an additional 3,000 well-equipped and trained troops .
Following King Abdullah II of Jordan 's intervention , Israel appears to have agreed to allow the Badr Brigade 's entry with full arms and ammunition .
If Fatah is to become a viable partner for peace and regain its grassroots support , it must reform itself and end the widespread corruption that has undermined its reputation .
Abbas must also share power with more disciplined , younger leaders .
Israel can help Abbas by releasing senior Fatah leader Marwan Barghouti , who is currently serving five life sentences in an Israeli prison .
Owing to his influence with the Fatah militias , Barghouti 's release could help Abbas and the discredited Fatah leadership , and boost the younger generation of Fatah leaders .
Israel is divided on how to deal with Hamas , which will also complicate the start of peace talks .
Some Israelis argue that Hamas should be encouraged to establish order in Gaza and provide assurances to its neighbors .
If Hamas can establish order inside Gaza , prevent violence against Israel , and stop missile attacks against Israeli towns and villages , it might avoid Israeli military intervention .
But the dominant view in Israel is that Hamas is a direct threat , unwilling to stop attacks on Israel .
For Israel , last summer 's fight with Hezbollah in Lebanon demonstrated the risks of allowing radical Islamists to consolidate their power on Israel 's border .
Sooner or later , Israel is likely to deal with Hamas militarily , perhaps even by re-occupying Gaza .
One reason neighboring countries may take part in peace talks is that Egypt and Jordan fear that Hamas could begin actively to support these countries ' own Islamic opposition groups .
Moreover , Egypt , Jordan , and Saudi Arabia -- the three main Sunni Muslim regimes -- are concerned that Gaza could provide a base for their regional non-Arab foe , Shiite Iran .
Their fear is based on Iranian support for Islamist groups -- Sunni and Shiite -- in Iraq , Lebanon , and Palestine , as well as its ongoing relationship with Syria .
If the Hamas-Fatah split brings about another territorial partition , Palestinians ' national aspirations will suffer their gravest setback in the last half-century .
Although the overwhelming majority of Palestinians reject the use of force to settle this power struggle , many welcome the change in Gaza , where Hamas has cleared the streets of armed militias and restored some law and order .
The Palestinians confront a harsh reality .
Whatever actions are taken to confront Hamas will undermine the Palestinian national project .
A house divided against itself can not stand , said Abraham Lincoln .
And a Palestine divided against itself will never secure its independence .
Hamas Takes on the Radicals
Hamas Takes on the Radicals GAZA CITY -- The recent shoot-out in a Gaza mosque between Hamas security officers and militants from the radical jihadi group the Warriors of God brought to the surface the deep tensions that divide Palestinian Islamists .
Twenty-two people died , including the Warriors of God 's leader , Abdel Latif Moussa .
But Palestinian security officials doubt that these will be the last casualties .
With Hamas in control for more than two years , the Gaza Strip has long been considered much more traditional and conservative than the West Bank .
Nevertheless , in Gaza 's political milieu , Hamas is a moderate Islamic group that opposes al-Qaeda-style extremism .
But such extremist Islamic groups have been gaining support in Gaza , and Hamas has noticed .
The shoot-out in the mosque shows that Hamas will be ruthless in taking them on .
Various Salafi extremist groups have been operating in Gaza for years .
Salafis , whose name is derived from the Arabic phrase for `` righteous ancestors , '' known as `` Salaf al-Salih , '' insist on a return to what they consider the purity of the practices of the first Muslims .
Hamas has , in the past , cooperated with some of the Salafis , assuming they would stand behind Hamas 's leadership .
The Army of Islam joined in the raid that abducted the Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in June 2006 .
The group also took responsibility for the 2007 kidnapping of the BBC 's Gaza correspondent Alan Johnston , who was later released after negotiations led by Hamas .
The Warriors of God is one of a handful of radical , al-Qaeda-inspired groups to have appeared in the Gaza Strip in recent months , first coming to public attention in June after claiming responsibility for a failed horseback attack on Israel from Gaza .
Their Web site shares images , language , and music with al-Qaeda and other jihadi groups .
In a recent declaration , the group made favorable mention of al-Qaeda leaders Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri .
The Warriors of God demands a pure form of Islamic practice throughout the Gaza Strip , including the implementation of Sharia religious law and a rejection of democracy .
Indeed , the confrontation at the mosque followed the declaration of an Islamic Caliphate in Gaza , a flagrant rejection of Hamas 's authority .
Many young men in Gaza have become increasingly radicalized .
Pakistani-style dress has become common , as is the long hair that is thought to resemble the style of the Prophet Mohammad .
At the same time , violence against `` law-breakers '' is on the rise . Internet cafes have been bombed , institutions with Christian affiliations burned down , foreign schools attacked , and wedding parties assaulted .
There are substantial ideological differences between Gaza 's Salafi al-Qaeda affiliates and Hamas .
As a ruling party , Hamas has insisted that its sole concern is the Palestinian people , not a global Islamic revolution .
Hamas has not imposed Islamic law in the Gaza Strip .
The Salafi groups , however , appear increasingly influenced by the growth of radical al-Qaeda-style extremism in Pakistan , Iraq , and Afghanistan .
While traditional Salafi movements have stayed away from politics , the younger groups see activism and violence as the best means of realizing their goals .
But Hamas 's failure to establish and implement Islamic law is not the only issue that rankles .
One of the reasons for these groups ' increased appeal is the de facto cease-fire between Israel and Hamas , which has led some in Gaza to charge that Hamas has been neutralized as a resistance force .
With the border closed under Israeli blockade for more than two years , levels of poverty , unemployment , and despair have grown , with young men increasingly interested in joining the global jihad as it comes to Gaza .
Indeed , Hamas ' confrontation with Salafi groups comes as Israel is charging that dozens of foreign terrorists have crossed into Gaza from the Sinai Desert to join the violent underground .
Hamas 's crackdown thus highlights its desire to maintain control over its conflict with Israel .
The threat of Salafi extremism in Gaza is far from over .
Salafis have threatened to retaliate against Hamas , particularly the security brigades that led the counter-attack on the mosque .
A new Salafi group called the Brigade of Swords of Righteousness has declared its obedience to the Warriors of God , and has warned Gazans to stay away from government buildings , security headquarters , mosques attended by Hamas leaders , and other official buildings .
The group now considers these legitimate targets .
With hundreds of tunnels connecting the Gaza Strip and Sinai , it is very difficult to control the flow of arms , ammunition , and possibly foreign fighters .
Hamas 's battle with these radicals , who detonated suicide bombs and killed six Hamas security men during the mosque fight , is just beginning .
Residents are afraid that Gaza could become another Iraq , with bombings and mass killings a daily occurrence .
Hamas will use all means necessary to protect its power , and to break the jihadi groups now spreading in Gaza .
In the process , Hamas hopes to win the international legitimacy that it has long sought .
Hamas , Fatah , and the Palestinian Dilemma
GAZA CITY -- With dueling authorities running Gaza and the West Bank , the Palestinian people find themselves in the middle of an experiment .
In Gaza , where Hamas is in charge , the high price of armed resistance to Israel has discredited any attempts to revive the conflict .
In the West Bank , under Fatah rule , negotiations have gone nowhere .
Neither track of Palestinian politics -- resistance or negotiation -- offers hope of achieving independence .
As a result , Palestinians face their most difficult challenge since 1948 .
Israeli threats of renewing its war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip are taken very seriously .
The scenes of devastation are still vivid in the streets and neighborhoods of Gaza , and Hamas is taking no chances of provoking Israel into a new war .
The fighting cost Hamas two of its top leaders , Saeed Siyam and Nizar Rayan , and significantly weakened its military capabilities . Only recently have these been rebuilt .
Hamas finds itself in a difficult position , since its policy calls for strong resistance , alongside politics .
Yet this policy has failed .
Hamas has put pressure on all resistance groups in Gaza to refrain from provoking Israel .
In an unprecedented statement , Mahmoud al-Zahar , a top Hamas leader , said any missiles fired at Israel from Gaza would be `` betrayal missiles . ''
Instead , Hamas has turned its attention to the West Bank , where it has no political authority .
It has called on Palestinians there to launch a new intifada against Israel , even while insisting on calm in the Gaza Strip .
Fatah , which runs the West Bank , wants no part of another Palestinian uprising .
President Mahmoud Abbas has made no secret of his objection to such a strategy .
But , with their government unable to do anything about the expansion of Israeli settlements , including in East Jerusalem , as well as continued conflicts over holy sites in Hebron , Bethlehem , and the Al-Aksa mosque , West Bank Palestinians are extremely frustrated .
Recent street demonstrations could easily turn into an outbreak of ongoing resistance to Israeli rule .
The Palestinian Authority , which runs the West Bank , is afraid that a popular , non-violent intifada might quickly turn violent .
If so , Israel might use it as a pretext to crush the Palestinians and their newly built institutions .
This has happened before , during the last intifada in 2002 .
There is another scenario that also terrifies Fatah leaders .
An outbreak of violence could strengthen Hamas and its military wing , Al-Qassam Brigades , in the West Bank .
This , in turn , could produce a repeat of the scenario that brought Hamas to power in Gaza in June 2007 , when all Fatah authority in the area collapsed after the Israeli withdrawal .
Yet the peace process has been stalled for more than a year , greatly reducing Fatah 's credibility in the West Bank .
Abbas has repeatedly described peace as a strategic choice for the Palestinians .
But , 17 years since the signing of the Oslo agreement and the launch of bilateral talks between the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel , there has been very little movement toward a Palestinian state .
In popular opinion , negotiations have reached a dead end .
Arab diplomats also show few signs of optimism .
At its recent summit in Libya , the Arab League rejected the proximity talks proposed by the United States ' Middle East peace envoy , George Mitchell .
The Arab position is that no proximity talks can be held until Israel freezes its settlement activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem .
Palestinian and Arab opinion is waiting for the US , as Israel 's ally , to intervene and press for concessions .
Though the Palestinian economy in the West Bank has improved greatly under Prime Minister Salam Fayyad , this is no substitute for serious peace negotiations .
In August 2009 , Fayyad declared his vision of a Palestinian state in two years .
Under his blueprint , which has received strong financial support from the US and the European Union , the political , economic , and security infrastructure of the Palestinian state would be ready by August 2011 .
Fayyad has also gained the backing of Fatah and most other Palestinian groups in the West Bank .
Fayyad 's strategy for international recognition of a Palestinian state is to fight a legal battle against Israel in the United Nations Security Council and other international bodies .
He is convinced that establishing a Palestinian state would serve the interest of all parties , and that the odds favor the Palestinians in international political struggle .
Hamas does not share this view , and Palestinian reconciliation efforts have reached an impasse .
The Arab League has given Egypt the lead role in bringing the two sides together , but Hamas has spurned Egypt 's proposals .
Now , with questions about President Hosni Mubarak 's successor in the air , Egypt has put aside these talks .
Palestinians are looking instead to Iran , Hamas ' ally , for signs of any revival in discussions between Fatah and Hamas .
Palestinians ' choices are limited , and there is no consensus among them on how to proceed .
But there is a growing sense that the waiting game can not last much longer . Whatever comes next will most likely come soon .
The Hamas Veto
The Hamas Veto GAZA CITY -- The resumption of direct peace talks between the Palestinians and Israelis has broken 20 months of stalemate , and marked the entry of Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu into this round of diplomacy .
But these difficult talks face significant challenges from outside the negotiating room , particularly from Hamas , which is intent on ensuring that nothing happens without its approval .
It is possible for a child born just ten years from now to live in a world where AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria are on the wane .
But this can only happen with considerable investment .
Now .
Otherwise , today 's grim picture will only get worse .
Each day , these diseases kill 16,000 people -- devastating entire communities and plummeting countries deeper into poverty .
Upping the ante could turn the tables .
Recent successes in Brazil against AIDS , in Mozambique against malaria , and in China against TB , show what can be achieved on a global scale with more resources .
There are new ways of directing aid to where it is most needed .
A key instrument is the Global Fund to Fight AIDS , TB and Malaria .
Created in 2002 as a partnership between governments and civil society , the Global Fund is unique in the way it aims to deliver assistance .
Driven by real needs on the ground , projects are designed and implemented by recipients , and its procedures and operations are transparent .
Of late there has been much talk about intensifying efforts to eradicate poverty .
Ahead of the G8 summit in Scotland in July , a coalition of non-governmental organizations has launched the `` Global Call to Action Against Poverty , '' and the UK host has made Africa a top priority .
Building on this momentum , the campaigns for debt relief , trade reform , and increasing aid to poor countries have gained traction .
Yet , while pledges to increase development assistance have soared , short-term funding is woefully inadequate .
Any strategy for raising living standards must include urgent measures that address AIDS , TB and malaria .
Stemming the spread of this deadly trio of diseases is the linchpin in the global fight against poverty .
Unchecked , these diseases not only sap the strength of national economies , but jeopardize peace and security .
Teachers and nurses are dying ; police and security forces are being hard hit , and 14 million children have already been orphaned by AIDS .
We now risk failing to meet the Millennium Development GOAL , set out by the United Nations , of reversing the spread of AIDS , TB and malaria by 2015 . This failure will make remote any hope of reaching the other Millennium goals in the fight against poverty .
A comprehensive response to AIDS , TB and malaria is needed .
Acting now means less spending in the long run .
Investments in effective prevention , treatment and research in 2005 and 2006 will save millions of lives , lessen the socio-economic impact of the diseases in poorer countries , and remove the need for increased spending on these chronic crises in the future .
The Global Fund plays an important role in this funding environment , providing approximately 66 % of all current external funds in the fight against TB , 45 % in the fight against malaria , and 20 % of all external support to combat HIV\/AIDS .
The Global Fund is not perfect ; as with all new organizations , it is experiencing growing pains .
They now have a chance to make good on their word .
With many battles ahead in the fight against AIDS , TB and malaria , it would be a disgrace if this opportunity is squandered .
Oil 's Upward March
IRVING , TEXAS -- When OPEC members met in Vienna recently , the Saudis failed to control the meeting , OPEC 's production ceiling remained unchanged , and member countries are setting their own output levels .
But talk of an OPEC breakup is premature .
After all , it has survived major wars , numerous diplomatic disputes , and two major market collapses .
In fact , the secret to OPEC 's survival is its weakness , not its strength .
Friction or no friction , OPEC has been , and will always be , irrelevant to market forces on the ground .
OPEC has never had market power , but Saudi Arabia has , and Saudi market power has always been assigned , mistakenly , to OPEC .
The Saudis did not like the recent meeting .
They decided to go it alone .
Can they deliver ?
The answer is no. .
The recent move by the 28-member International Energy Agency to release oil from strategic reserves proves this point .
The global oil market has become a large sea that generates its own storms , which guarantee that the sea will continue to grow .
Looking at recent history , one can identify four factors that will continue to drive oil prices higher unless a major earthquake brings the market to its knees .
The first factor is the relationship between oil prices and economic growth in the oil-producing countries .
Higher prices fuel higher growth in these countries , which , accompanied by a population boom , leads to higher domestic energy consumption .
That , in turn , reduces oil exports , driving up prices further .
Only a major recession could break this cycle ; otherwise , we are headed for an energy crisis .
Of course , prices can not continue to rise indefinitely -- the price increase will ration demand .
The increase in energy demand has already led to power shortages in the oil-producing countries , which are expected to reduce exports this summer .
More crude oil will be burned in power plants , more diesel will be burned in private generators , and more gasoline will be burned in SUVs from Riyadh to Kuwait City during blackouts in which the only place to keep cool will be in a moving car .
Second , there is the relationship between oil prices and the need for income diversification in the oil-producing countries .
As oil prices rise , these countries ' dependence on the oil sector increases , despite all efforts to diversify their economies .
To combat the impact of such dependence , they spend oil revenues on other sectors , leaving the oil sector with little investment .
As global oil demand increases , there is not enough capacity to meet it -- a cycle that will continue until demand collapses .
The rhetoric of energy independence in the oil-consuming countries makes the situation even worse : the oil-producing countries are building energy-intensive industries to guarantee a market for their oil once consuming nations wean themselves of imported oil .
They intend to export oil embedded in other products , such as petrochemicals , plastic , aluminum , etc. . And they can build such plants in faster than the oil-consuming countries can establish alternatives to oil imports , exacerbating future shortages .
Again , higher prices will ration global oil demand , but only after a period of economic pain in some regions around the world .
The third factor is the vicious circle of oil prices and the value of the US dollar .
Higher oil prices increase America 's trade deficits , which in turn lower the value of the dollar . Owing to the inverse relationship between oil prices and the dollar , the weaker dollar increases oil prices , which increases the trade deficit further , putting more downward pressure on the dollar .
Oil prices will continue to rise until demand collapses .
Statistical evidence suggests that this relationship will weaken once the real-estate market recovers , but this remains a long-run prospect .
Finally , there is the relationship between oil prices and fiscal and monetary policies in the oil-consuming countries .
To combat the effect of high oil prices , consuming countries adopt expansionary economic policies , lowering interest rates and increasing government spending .
This enables continued economic growth with high oil prices .
But continued growth increases demand for oil , sending prices even higher . The alternative to monetary and fiscal expansion is recession , at which point oil prices would stop rising .
Given the current turmoil in the Middle East , the loss of Libyan and Yemeni oil , and increasing energy demand in the oil-producing countries , any increase in Saudi oil exports , if any , would have a limited impact on the market .
Oil production does not matter ; exports do , which means that announcements of increases in oil output are irrelevant for prices .
Indeed , regardless of what OPEC or its members decide , the vicious cycles described here will support oil prices around the world probably in the range of $ 70 - $ 90 per barrel .
That said , OPEC members and oil-consuming countries policymakers alike should not forget that nothing cures high prices like high prices .
The Promise of Euro-Atlantic Missile Defense
The Promise of Euro-Atlantic Missile Defense BRUSSELS -- The new strategic arms reduction treaty -LRB- START -RRB- that Russian President Dmitri Medvedev and US President Barack Obama just signed in Prague is an historic achievement , and an inspiration for further progress in global arms control . But at the same time , here and now , we must also prepare to defend against another , less encouraging trend .
The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery is a threat to both the NATO allies and Russia .
A look at current trends shows that more than 30 countries have or are developing missile capabilities .
In many cases , these missiles could eventually threaten Europe 's populations and territories .
Iran is a case in point .
It has signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , and is developing a nuclear program that it claims is for civilian purposes only .
But Iran has gone far beyond what is necessary for a purely civilian program . It has concealed several nuclear facilities from the International Atomic Energy Agency , played hide-and-seek with the international community , and rejected all offers of cooperation from the United States , the European Union , and others .
Most recently , Iran 's government announced plans to enrich its uranium to levels that appear incompatible with civilian use and that defy several United Nations Security Council resolutions .
Iran also has an extensive missile development program . Iranian officials declare that the range of their modified Shahab-3 missiles is 2,000 kilometers , putting Allied countries such as Turkey , Greece , Romania , and Bulgaria within reach .
In February 2009 , Iran introduced the SAFIR 2 space launch vehicle .
This is a key stage in the development of intermediate - and intercontinental-range missiles .
If Iran completes this development , the whole of Europe , as well as all of Russia , would be within its range .
Proliferators must know that the NATO allies are unwavering in their commitment to collective defense , including nuclear deterrence .
Confronted with the spread of missile technology , and unpredictable regimes and leaders , we owe it to our populations to complement our deterrence capabilities with an effective missile-defense capability .
We are not starting from scratch .
NATO allies have been looking at various missile-defense options for some time .
NATO itself is developing protections for our deployed troops .
But with the new US approach to missile defense , there are now much better opportunities for an effective NATO-wide system that would enhance the territorial defense of our populations and nations .
A true joint Euro-Atlantic missile defense would demonstrate NATO 's collective will , not only to defend against the new threats of today and tomorrow , but also to send a clear message that there is nothing to be gained from missile proliferation .
It can also provide an opportunity for Europeans to demonstrate again to the US their willingness to invest in self-defense capabilities , and to play an active role in a process that , until now , has been conducted largely over their heads , by the US and Russia .
But there is another reason for developing missile defense : to create a new dynamic in European and Euro-Atlantic security .
There is much talk these days about the Euro-Atlantic security architecture .
Russia , in particular , has focused on treaties , conferences , and political arrangements .
Clearly , these things can be useful and important .
We should talk .
We should look for common political approaches , many of which we have already agreed , and could easily endorse again .
But , to my mind , a joint security architecture must move beyond blueprints .
It needs to be built .
And missile defense is a concrete way to do that .
In this respect , the news that the US and Russia have agreed on a follow-up treaty to START that will substantially cut both countries ' nuclear arsenals provides a good backdrop .
This new agreement makes the world safer , and it will give impetus to cooperation with Russia in other fields , particularly NATO-Russia relations .
Since taking office last summer , I have invested considerable time and effort in revitalizing the NATO-Russia relationship , with progress made in several areas , including a joint review of common threats and challenges .
But it is time to look at missile defense as another opportunity to bring us together .
We need a missile-defense system that includes not just all NATO countries , but Russia , too .
The more that missile defense is seen as a shared security roof -- built , supported , and operated together -- that protects us all , the more people from Vancouver to Vladivostok will know that they are part of one community .
Such a security roof would be a strong political symbol that Russia is fully part of the Euro-Atlantic family , sharing the costs and benefits .
Of course , there are practical challenges .
We would have to make our systems interoperable , share intelligence assessments , and link sensitive technologies .
But such cooperation is a concrete way to build mutual trust and confidence .
For these reasons , the time has come to move forward on missile defense .
We need a decision , by NATO 's next summit in November , that missile defense is an Alliance mission , and that we will explore every opportunity to cooperate with Russia .
But Russia also must decide to view missile defense as an opportunity , rather than a threat .
If that happens , we can move forward to create a missile-defense system that not only defends the Euro-Atlantic community , but that also brings it together .
The end of the Cold War has given us an enormous opportunity to achieve our goal of a Europe whole , free , and at peace .
We are not quite there , but we are getting there . Missile defense can be part of that positive trend .
Foreign policy disputes between Europe , France in particular , and the US are mounting , and not only over the Israeli-Palestinian bloodbath and the conduct of the anti-terrorism war .
But Europe 's criticisms , no matter how sound , will not be taken seriously by the US so long as the Continent continues to free-ride on America 's defenses , something it has done for half-a-century .
In a bellicose world , a credible voice in the international arena requires a creditable military capability and high-tech military technology .
In both , Europe is lacking .
America 's irritation with some of its European allies - Tony Blair 's UK being the noticeable exception - is understandable .
In the current fiscal year , the US will spend an additional $ 50 billion on defense , raising its overall defense bill to $ 379 billion , more than 3 % of GDP .
This sum is , in fact , low by post-WWII standards .
At the time of the Gulf War of 1991 , US defense spending was 4.8 % of GDP ; it was far higher in the 1950s and 1960s .
Europe 's commitment to defense tells another story .
Defense spending is 1.6 % of GDP in Germany , 2 % in Italy , and 1.5 % in Spain ; only France and the UK reach 3 % .
But confining discussion about defense commitment to the percent of GDP spent on the military is insufficient because there are economies of scale in defense spending .
So one would expect that smaller countries will spend proportionally more on defense than larger ones .
Instead , today America alone spends more than most of its NATO allies combined , and defense spending in the US is likely to increase even more in the years to come .
Security and global influence are not the only benefits that come through military expenditure .
About 10-15 % of US military spending finances basic research and thus provides a powerful boost to America 's high-tech research and development .
The internet , based on thinking and spending made in the 1940 's , and the silicon chip , developed in the 1970 's , are both products of research funded by the Pentagon .
The war in Afghanistan , which was truly revolutionary in the way it was conducted , proves how new information and communication technology can bring about success with a minimal number of men on the ground and minimal losses .
The Russians fought for ten hard years over the same terrain in Afghanistan .
Lacking comparable technology , they lost tens of thousands of men and were eventually defeated .
At the beginning of the Afghan campaign many military `` experts '' feared that the US would face a similar fate .
How wrong they were !
Europe lags behind the US in R&D , and its stinginess over defense contributes mightily to a growing high tech `` investment gap . ''
Data concerning patents documents America 's advantage : in the late 1990s 56 % of all global patents in high-tech fields was granted to US applicants , only 11 % to EU applicants .
The connection between R&D and growth is too obvious to doubt that Europe 's sluggish economies are a direct result of European backwardness at innovation - and that this in turn may reflect the absence of critical military spending to drive investments in research and development .
The ongoing dispute between Europe and the US over the choice of the military transport plane - to be used to deploy the new 60,000 strong European Rapid Reaction Force - is symptomatic of Europe 's problems .
America would like Europe to opt for an aircraft built by Boeing and Lockheed Martin .
Europe is divided : some countries , notably Italy , support the US ; others , notably France and Germany , argue in favor of a European plane built by Airbus in a $ 15 billion publicly funded project .
This is an issue on which Europe should stand up to the US .
The EU should fund the Airbus project and make sure that an important fraction of the money goes into R&D to foster the growth of an industry that is one of the few European high-tech success stories .
In recent weeks European defense ministers suggested that increases in military expenditures should be excluded from the budget constraints imposed by the Euro stability pact .
The idea that a sharp increase in military spending in a -LRB- hopefully temporarily -RRB- bellicose world should be amortized with some deficits is consistent with sound economic policy , but only if the rest of the budget remains `` lean . ''
This is the case in America , where nobody really worries if increased military spending will create a temporary deficit .
Not in Europe .
An increase in military spending , in conjunction with an enforcement of the stability pact , should bring about a trimming of the non-defense budget : the public sector wage bill and a welfare state grown far beyond the goal of supporting the incomes of the poor , would of necessity need to be trimmed sharply .
For half-a-century Europe has relied on the US for security , while spending its own money on a pricey welfare state .
This can no longer continue - at least not if the EU is serious about playing a leading role in the world .
Argentina : Open Up or Shut Down
Argentina : Open Up or Shut Down
`` I have an important political mission , '' Eduardo Amadeo said on being appointed Argentina 's ambassador to Washington . `` I must explain our transition . ''
But diplomatic explanations are not what Argentina needs .
It does not need to waste scarce money on diplomacy of dubious value -- not when the country lacks an agency dedicated to helping Argentine businessmen sell their goods abroad .
Indeed , the sum Argentina spends on its diplomats is what tiny Ireland spends on its Export Promotion Agency , an institution Argentina never bothered to create .
Instead of talking to fellow diplomats , Argentina 's ambassador to the US should talk to US supermarkets , convincing their managers to buy Argentine goods and arranging for them to meet with small businessmen from his country .
He should not be duplicating what Argentina 's President and Foreign Minister are capable of doing .
Export diplomacy is important , but export promotion , visiting stores and talking to buyers , is even more vital .
European grocery shops are full of products from Israel , but how often do you see Argentine beef or other goods ?
Argentina 's economy opened up significantly in recent years , notwithstanding a strong exchange rate , which made exporting difficult .
Total exports doubled in 1991-2001 , from US$ 12 billion to $ 25 billion , with industrial exports growing from $ 3 billion to $ 8 billion .
But the numbers remain very small .
In fact , Argentina is amazingly closed for an economy its size .
Exports do not exceed 10 % of GDP , and manufactured goods account for only about a third of total exports .
Brazil , a country eight times the size , exports 12 % of its economy 's output , and 57 % of Brazilian exports are manufactured goods .
Chile exports almost 30 % of its output .
Some small European countries come close to 50 % .
Little wonder , then , that Argentina 's current crisis is so harsh : the portion of its economy that can generate the export revenues necessary to repay foreign debt is too small .
When a country reaches the point that it needs all its exports to service its national debt , and the size of the export sector is fixed , nothing is left to pay for imports .
So imports dry up and the economy stops .
The more open an economy is , the more easily it can avoid this trap .
Of course , all countries eventually overcome crises .
The question is how .
Argentina now faces a choice that is both economic and political .
The path of development that it chooses as it emerges from its crisis will determine the country 's future for many years to come .
So it is surprising that this choice is not at the center of the political debate in the campaign for the presidency now underway .
There are two ways out of the current morass .
One is the old model : a recovery in real wages and a resumption of consumption .
Viewed from the despairing perspective of today 's crisis , this model seems like a dream .
But if it is implemented , in 3-5 years Argentina will look exactly like the country we have always known : a largely closed economy that remains dangerously vulnerable to external shocks .
The alternative is to capitalize on the unique opportunity that this year 's devaluation of the peso offers by making the competitiveness gains last long enough to shift resources into the export sector .
Of course , this will depress real wages and consumption , because the rise in peso revenues will be used instead to finance the investment needed to expand the export sector .
This will lead to the creation of new firms and the retooling of existing ones to make them fit to export .
Eventually productivity gains in a larger export sector will drive up real wages and consumption .
In short , Argentina 's economy must open up or risk shutting down .
Policy can help open it up .
By keeping the price of public services frozen , the government would win on two fronts : inflation would be held in check and altered incentives would shift investment from the domestic sector towards exporting firms .
In the old model returns come quicker , but the long-term implications are gloomy , because the economy would remain saddled with the same problems it has confronted for decades .
The alternative is to look forward and asks what type of country Argentines want to leave to future generations .
There should be no doubt as to the answer to this question , except in the minds of politicians who fail to raise it because they refuse to think beyond the coming presidential election .
Perhaps it is not by chance that Argentina has the largest number of psychology students in the world .
If you are a closed and inward-looking country , you are bound to need lots of psychologists .
The minister for education would do her country a profound service if she were to re-allocate resources to courses designed to train export promoters .
Teach young people some basic marketing skills and then send them out to Argentina 's embassies . They will work wonders , unlike the cheap talk of Ambassador Amadeo at Washington dinner tables .
The Big Bang of Economic Freedom
The Big Bang of Economic Freedom
Why is it so difficult to implement the deregulation needed to make an economy more competitive ?
Why do so many governments try to achieve this end , and why do almost all of them fail ?
All citizens stand to benefit from competitive markets for products and services , but more often than not , the broad coalition required to sustain pro-competitive policies never materializes ; political support simply is n't there .
Why ?
This question is important not only in transition economies and other emerging market countries , but in rich countries as well -- in fact almost everywhere , except possibly the US and the UK , which long ago embarked on a process of radical and far-reaching economic liberalization .
New Zealand and Ireland followed suit and their economies have been booming ever since .
Lack of competition is typically due to over-regulation .
Taxicabs in European cities are expensive because the number of licenses is strictly controlled .
With market entry blocked , license owners face little pressure to hold down fares , and the officials who allocate licenses are well placed to collect votes or bribes .
In short , regulation tends to distort incentives , stimulating what economists call rent-seeking behavior : the taxi driver and the license official collect unearned premiums -LRB- rents -RRB- solely because they can exploit their position as insiders , not because they are more productive .
Notaries are another example of this phenomenon . Public notaries in many countries charge extremely high fees for services that are virtually useless .
Fees are high because the notaries themselves control access to their profession .
Without government regulation -LRB- including rules requiring that consumers purchase their useless services -RRB- , public notaries would not have the position from which they draw rents .
Examples of the benefits of deregulation abound .
The taxi market in Ireland is deregulated , and fares there are cheap .
For some time after US airlines were deregulated , the five-hour flight from New York to Los Angeles cost much less than the half-hour trip from Zurich to Frankfurt .
Similar discrepancies were found in the price of a coast-to-coast phone call in the US and that of a domestic long-distance call in France .
Whereas regulation creates unearned rents for overprotected minorities -LRB- taxi drivers , notaries , airline pilots , and telecom or electricity workers -RRB- , deregulation reduces these rents and redistributes them to the general public .
But because overprotected minorities enjoy privileged access to politicians , it is no surprise that deregulation incites so much fierce -- and effective -- opposition .
Public utilities are a good example of this .
Whenever a government attempts to liberalize the electricity industry , unions and firms join forces in opposition .
Workers and management oppose deregulation because openness to competition would eliminate their unearned premiums .
The wages of electrical workers are high precisely because they have appropriated a part of the rents created in an uncompetitive electricity market .
Is there a way to weaken this opposition ?
What if a government , instead of fighting the electricity industry alone , unleashed an economic `` big bang , '' trying to liberalize most markets at once ?
An analogous `` all or nothing '' procedure was used in the US in the 1980s to close unneeded military bases .
Since 1945 , there had not been a single base closure .
Even though the Pentagon itself wanted to close many of them and use the money elsewhere , no measure could be gotten through the Congress , because military bases qualify as `` pork '' - the favors for their constituents that help congressmen get re-elected -- and , according to old and sacred informal rules , no congressman will ever vote against pork in a colleague 's district .
But a plan to close numerous bases passed by an overwhelming majority when the congressional leadership finally agreed to present a single list of bases to be closed ; the list could only be voted up or down , without any possibility of amendments .
Good sense triumphed over pork .
The cause of economic liberalization would be greatly advanced by adopting similar strategies .
For example , electricity workers would realize that , as consumers , their gains from lower prices throughout the economy more than compensate them for the loss of rents in their own firms .
The big bang approach gives workers a stake in liberalization and thus makes deregulation politically easier to pursue .
Deregulating product markets has an additional benefit : it facilitates liberalization of the labor market . Evidence gathered by the OECD shows a strong positive correlation across countries between the degree of competition in the product market and the extent to which labor market regulations increase the powers of workers when they bargain with firms .
Bargaining is mostly about the distribution of excess rents between the firm and its workers .
In a competitive industry , where there are no excess rents , there is little to bargain about .
In some cases , however , regulation works in the opposite direction : it keeps the price of public services artificially low , rather than too high .
This is true of railway fares throughout continental Europe , which are subsidized by government .
Here again , winning the battle for deregulation requires convincing consumers that they stand to benefit .
Railway fares will be higher , but taxes will be lower , because only those who actually use trains will pay the costs , rather than the non-traveling taxpayers .
Deregulations of airlines and bus transportation will also create healthy competition for railroads and help keep prices from rising too far .
Piecemeal deregulation is doomed to fail .
Generating sufficient political support to enact reforms that can survive the opposition of vested interests requires attempting to deregulate the entire economy simultaneously , not select industries , one by one .
The key to eliminating inefficient , unproductive subsidies to minorities is to implement tax reductions for all .
Europe 's University Challenge
Europe 's University Challenge
The university systems in the US and Continental Europe could n't be more different .
Which works better ?
The answer is clear : America 's by a long shot .
European universities are generally based on three misguided principles :
This system is supposedly more egalitarian than America 's system of higher education , which many Europeans look down on as elitist .
In reality , Europe 's system typically produces less research , worse students -LRB- especially at the doctoral level -RRB- , and is probably less egalitarian than the US system .
Having taxpayers cover the costs of university education is indeed redistributive , but in the wrong direction -- the beneficiaries are most often the children of comfortable European families .
Even taking a generous view , the best that can be said is that the system is neutral insofar as redistribution is concerned , because the wealthiest pay more taxes and use more university services .
In addition to favoring Europe 's `` haves , '' this system makes it virtually impossible for self-financed private universities to survive .
In fact , this is probably the true motivation of Europe 's free public university system : to maintain the state 's monopoly on higher education .
But consider , instead , the US system : students pay for their education and , with part of the tuition these students pay , universities finance scholarships for deserving but poor students .
Such a system is at least as `` fair '' as Europe 's model , and probably more so than one in which taxpayers pay for everybody , including the rich .
Indeed , recent research comparing education in the US and Italy finds that family income is more important in determining a student 's success -LRB- measured in terms of his salary -RRB- in `` egalitarian '' Italy than it is in `` elitist '' America .
But competition is as important as financing in determining a university 's quality , because competition increases the merit of the product .
This is true in the US system , where public and private universities coexist happily .
The University of California at Berkeley is public .
Stanford University , an hour away down the coast , is private .
Both are among America 's finest universities .
Competition between them works because it involves fighting for the best students and offering scholarships to deserving poor ones .
By contrast , Europe 's centralization and bureaucratization control over universities produces only mediocrity .
Appointments in European universities are often governed by complex bureaucratic processes that involve countless `` judges '' chosen from all over a country .
This process is supposedly designed to `` guarantee '' that the best are appointed .
In reality , however , these judges make it easier for insiders to appoint their friends , rather than for the quality of research and teaching to determine who is hired .
Some countries , take France , are changing their systems by appointing a few academics from other countries onto hiring and promotion committees .
While this is obviously a move in the right direction , it will produce few results .
The best American universities operate their hiring processes internally , relying on outsiders only for expert opinions on the quality of a candidate professor 's research .
What produces good appointments is the threat that mediocre professors will make it difficult to attract good students and large research grants .
Europe 's tendency to equalize salary and treatment of professors and researchers also reduces the incentive to engage in good research and good teaching .
If the only factor that increases a professor 's salary is the passage of time , why make the extra effort to excel ?
Of course , love of research and teaching is why many people join university faculties in the first place , but why not give these noble sentiments a helping hand with appropriate financial incentives ?
Low salaries are often part of an implicit bargain : in exchange for the bad pay , university administrators close their eyes to lazy teaching and research .
Moreover , if salaries are low , how can university deans stop their faculty members from scouring the country to do lucrative consulting ?
The result is bad teaching , lousy research , and absentee professors .
US universities often use aggressive financial incentives and differential treatment of professors to reward good teaching and research .
Also , the private nature of contracts between an American university and its professors creates healthy competition for talent and a flexible and efficient market for scientists .
The result is that it is not uncommon for a bright , productive young professor in America to earn as much , if not more , than older and less productive colleagues .
In Europe , promising young researchers struggle and have to supplement teaching and research with outside jobs , while established professors earn good salaries .
Given these conditions , it should surprise no one that American universities nowadays are increasingly staffed by many of Europe 's best scholars .
What is surprising in the face of this brain drain is the power of the lobby of university professors in Europe to block reform .
Old and Aging Europe
Old and Aging Europe
When US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld spoke recently of `` Old Europe , '' he was right , but not in the way he intended .
Europe is indeed old , and growing older .
Fertility rates -LRB- the number of children per woman in the population -RRB- have fallen to 1.2 % in Germany and Italy .
The rate is even lower in Spain -- in fact , the lowest in Europe .
Spain is still a young society , but a society without children is doomed .
The fertility rate for the US , by contrast , is 2.4 , and it is 2.1 for the UK .
These differences are extraordinary , particularly in view of the far less generous maternity leave policies that apply in the US and the UK relative to continental Europe .
France stands out on the Continent with a fertility rate of 1.8 , which is most likely the result of years of generous tax policies towards large families .
Migration is also an important explanation for these differences .
Higher fertility rates in the US , the UK , and France reflect the large number of immigrant families in each country .
Fertility rates among immigrants are typically higher than in native European or North American families .
But increasing the number of immigrant workers will not necessarily raise fertility rates .
Germany , for example , has a large population of guest workers , but few settle there with their families ; most leave their children in their homeland .
An aging population contributes to Europe 's poor economic performance .
The old do not work , and a smaller and smaller share of the population -LRB- the disappearing young -RRB- is taxed to support them .
In turn , the high tax rates needed to support the old discourage the young from working , creating a vicious cycle : ever increasing tax rates on a disappearing labor force , lower growth rates , and fewer resources available to support those that retire at 60 and live into their 90 's .
The effects of this are partly offset by the fact that , with fewer children , more women enter the labor force .
But then these women also retire -LRB- often at an even younger age than men -RRB- adding to the `` unsupported '' army of retirees .
Compare this with the US , where participation by women in the labor force also is increasing , despite America 's higher fertility rate .
Indeed , female participation in the workforce is higher in the US than in the European Union -LRB- 70 % versus 60 % -RRB- .
The saving rates among Europe 's old people indicate that they are worried about the dwindling number of workers who can be taxed to support them .
Consider Germany . Any economic textbook will tell you -LRB- the famous `` life-cycle '' model -RRB- that the young save for their retirement , while the old spend what they accumulate .
But in Germany , the data seem to suggest a puzzling fact : the old save until their final days .
It is the young who spend .
Even more remarkable is not the level of savings among the old , but how it changes over time .
Recent German surveys have detected a small increase in their savings rate .
Why should old people save ?
The most plausible reason is that many now realize that they will live far longer than they anticipated -- often spending one-third of their lives in retirement -- but that the State may no longer deliver on its promises .
Default is unlikely , although not impossible , on pension benefits . But it is more likely on the provision of health services , by far the most important service for old people .
When you understand that you are likely to live into your late 80 's or beyond , and you also understand that the quality of public health services is deteriorating , you save more to take care of yourself .
So why do Europeans have fewer and fewer children ?
Indeed , non-working time even for those who hold jobs is increasing , offering ample opportunity to rear children .
Working hours in Europe as a whole fell from 1713 hours per year in 1980 to about 1576 today , with Germans putting in the least number of hours at work .
One explanation often mentioned points to a lack of support , such as public childcare , for mothers raising children .
But , then , why is America 's birth rate higher than in many countries in Europe that have much larger public support for childbearing mothers ?
High housing costs and imperfection in lending markets are the more likely explanation behind Europe 's falling fertility rates .
It is easier for a young couple to borrow and buy a house in the US than in Europe .
Rental markets are also more flexible in the US .
So another dangerously vicious circle seems to be operating : high taxes discourage work , and because fewer jobs are created , fertility is discouraged .
But with fewer children , higher tax rates are needed to support the growing army of the old .
Gunther Grass famously titled one of his novels `` Headbirths , or the Germans are Dying Out . ''
Little could he know how true his fantasy would just three decades later .
Europe 's Overdue Reformation
Europe 's Overdue Reformation
War and its huge cost ; the falling dollar ; mounting trade and budget deficits ; the chicanery that hollowed out companies like Enron and WorldCom ; the bursting of the high-tech bubble : capitalism American-style is both under strain and under a cloud .
From left to right , many European intellectuals think that the capitalist game as played by the US is passé .
An active search is on for new models .
Strong on rhetoric and fueled by a wave of anti-Americanism , that search is nonetheless thin on facts .
Stories of corporate malfeasance do , of course , abound in the US .
But it is facile to jump from individual corporate scandals to broad conclusions about the supposed rottenness of the American economy .
A close look at productivity growth -LRB- output per hour worked -RRB- in the US and Europe shows that US capitalism remains as vital than ever .
Having grown at an average annual rate of just 1.6 % since the early 1970 's , annual US productivity growth in the non-farm business sector has accelerated to an average of 2.6 % in the seven years since 1995 , with no sign of a slowdown .
In 2002 , productivity grew by 4.8 % - an extraordinary result , because productivity normally falls during economic slowdowns .
Now look at Europe .
Annual productivity growth actually slackened in the second half of the1990 's , from 2.5 % to just 1.3 % today .
This productivity gap is often attributed to the `` New Economy '' that emerged in the late 1990 's .
True , many new technologies were developed and first applied in the US .
But technology spreads rapidly : the same Windows or SAP programs are available in all countries , including Europe .
So there must be other differences .
Two candidates stand out : attitudes toward work and corporate governance .
Six OECD countries do better than America in terms of output per hour worked : Norway , Belgium , France , Ireland , the Netherlands , and Germany .
But the rankings change if you make output per capita -LRB- a better measure of a country 's economic well-being -RRB- the standard : here the US comes first , and France and Germany drop , respectively , to 16th and 11th place .
The reason for examining output per person rather than output per hour worked is simple : what determines a nation 's wealth is how much each person works , and how many people work .
This is where the US overtakes Europe : fewer people work in Europe than in the US , and those in Europe who do work do n't work as much .
Annual hours worked in the US are about 1800 , about 1500 in France , and 1400 in Germany .
One reason why Europeans work less is because they pay more taxes , and high taxes are necessary to support those who do not work - an obvious vicious circle .
But something deeper is at work .
Perhaps the Europeans are perfectly happy to work less and enjoy more free time , both in terms of having more vacations during their working age , and spending less time in the active labor force .
This is a legitimate choice , but once made , Europeans should stop looking for scapegoats for slow growth .
For the source of the problem is neither the European Central Bank , nor the Stability Pact .
Europe grows less because it works less - and it should not be surprised if a number of so-called `` developing countries '' soon catch up with Europe in terms of income per capita .
The new economy arrived after a decade of deep transformation within US companies .
During the 1980 's , a wave of leveraged buyouts transformed US corporate culture , evidently making bosses more receptive to technological innovation .
Not so in Europe , where the interests of a company 's employees and their unions often come before those of its shareholders .
Indeed , at one European newspaper , articles that arrived via e-mail were re-typed by typographers : the technology for transferring them electronically was available , but not the work rules to allow the paper to apply it .
Unions are not the only culprits .
Many European firms have complex ownership structures , with large shareholders whose interests often conflict with those of the company - hardly the best way to take sound business decisions .
This is particularly true in finance and banking .
Whatever the corporate horror stories in US banks , almost no European investment bank remains , and Germany is seriously considering a state-owned `` bad bank '' to bail out its all-powerful banking giants .
If Europe wants to work less , it must be extraordinarily productive when it does work if it is to keep up with the hard-working Americans .
That is why Europeans should hope that the wave of corporate restructuring and reformation , which many thought would follow inevitably in the wake of the creation of the single market , begins to crest across the Continent and change the way businesses are run .
The Atlantic Divide In Black and White
The Atlantic Divide In Black and White
Relations between Continental Western Europe and the US have never been so strained in recent decades as they are now .
Is the cause a short-run disagreement about a specific issue , the war in Iraq ?
Or is the transatlantic ideological divide deep , pervasive , and unlikely to disappear anytime soon ?
Before diplomats and pundits begin to paper over the two sides ' differences , it is necessary to reflect on their sources .
For we believe that the transatlantic divide does mirror fundamental differences in values -- with the immediate caveat that these differences do not , and should not , bring the two sides into conflict .
The profoundly different values that America and Europe hold can best be viewed by examining how each perceives poverty , inequality , and the welfare state .
According to the World Value Survey , a respected attitudinal study conducted in about 40 countries , 60 % of Americans believe that the poor are `` lazy , '' a view shared by only 26 % of Europeans .
Nearly the exact opposite proportions -LRB- 60 % of Europeans and 29 % of Americans -RRB- believe that the poor are trapped in poverty .
Similarly , evidence drawn from surveys about well being indicates that Americans are much less bothered by inequality than Europeans .
In fact , even the American poor do not mind inequality , which they see as a social ladder that they can climb .
The European poor view inequality as an insurmountable social obstacle .
These basic differences lead to obvious consequences for social polices .
Europe spends twice as much as the US on social programs , and total government spending in Europe is close to 50 % of GDP .
In the US , government consumes about 30 % of GDP .
These numbers are not just about social spending , but have implication for issues like defense and foreign policy .
If Europe wants to play a more active role in international affairs it must become a military power : the US spends about 4 % of its GDP more than Europe for military purposes .
But this is difficult for Europe to achieve , let alone contemplate : looming deficits and exhausted taxpayers make it hard , if not impossible , to divert several percentage points of GDP to military spending .
But where do these differences in attitude toward fundamental issues like inequality come from ?
One explanation is that America is a more mobile society where the poor are not trapped and can seemingly get out of poverty if they really try .
If the poor remain poor , Americans conclude , it must be because they are lazy .
The European poor do not have such mobility and thus lack the supposed chance that poor Americans possess .
Even if they try hard , they feel trapped .
The alternative , and much more likely , explanation is that these differing views reflect profound ideological differences that pay little attention to economic reality .
In other words , the ideological differences across the Atlantic are much larger than actual differences in social mobility and the supposed laziness of the poor .
European culture remains profoundly affected by the Marxist intellectual tradition in which classes are viewed as cast in stone -- which implies that it is almost impossible for a poor person to become rich , or , apropos the tradition , for a `` proletarian '' to become a `` capitalist . '' Marxism assumes social immobility to justify the concept of `` class . ''
In many European countries , political institutions were shaped in revolutionary periods in which socialist parties and ideas enjoyed mass support .
In America , the Marxist cultural influence was very limited .
Indeed , outside of universities , it scarcely ruffled American life .
Instead , the culture -LRB- or myth -RRB- of the `` self-made man '' provides the ideological tool for America 's social conservatives to justify limited government intervention .
The US Constitution , though reshaped , amended , and adapted to fit changing times , reflects its origins as a document written and designed to protect private property against the predations of the State .
The second source of the transatlantic divide in attitudes toward fundamental issues like inequality has to do with racial bias .
The US is a racially fragmented society , so it is convenient for the majority of wealthy whites to view the poor -LRB- many of them black -RRB- as different and lazy compared to hard-working whites .
Indeed , even controlling for income , whites are much less receptive to redistributive policies than non-white Americans , precisely because they perceive them as favoring racial minorities .
Even poor whites oppose redistributive policies , owing to racial distrust , if not downright animosity .
Historically , America 's racial and ethnic divisions also inhibited the development of a homogeneous working-class culture and movement , which empowered socialist and Communist parties across Europe in the 20
In more homogeneous European countries , the differences between rich and poor are much less obvious : in Sweden , rich and poor are all white , often tall and blond .
Not surprisingly , the European right is beginning to use immigration as a tool to attack the welfare state .
As Europe becomes increasingly multi-cultural , political pressures against the welfare state seem certain to grow .
For now , Americans and Continental West Europeans remain very different in their basic attitudes concerning poverty , inequality , and the welfare state .
It remains to be seen whether these attitudes will persist in their current form , and whether the transatlantic divide widens or narrows .
Three years ago , the European single currency , the Euro , was born at an exchange rate of 1 : $ 1.17 , which presumably was deemed to reflect appropriately price levels on both sides of the Atlantic at that time .
The Euro 's exchange rate has since endured a roller-coaster ride .
Now , it has returned to almost exactly its opening level .
So why is the European business community claiming that the `` super Euro '' is bringing calamity down upon their heads ?
The answer is that blaming the Euro is an easy way to deflect attention from the true cause of Europe 's economic malaise : a surprisingly low level of productivity per capita .
It is important to clarify a few fundamental points regarding the Euro\/dollar exchange rate , because this is an issue on which confusion -- often generated strategically -- pervades public debate .
First , nobody knows how to explain or predict the short-term movements -LRB- from one day to six months , say -RRB- of exchange rates .
A famous academic paper about 20 years ago showed that a random walk was better at predicting short-run exchange rate movements than any fancy mathematical model based on selected economic variables .
That conclusion still applies .
Nobody had a clear idea why the Euro plummeted to almost $ 0.80 in its first year and a half of trading , and nobody could predict when it would recover .
Some observers attribute the current `` high '' level of the Euro -LRB- and thus low growth in Europe -RRB- to tight monetary policy on the part of the European Central Bank -LRB- ECB -RRB- .
But if high interest rates are causing the Euro 's rise , why was the dollar appreciating in periods when the US Federal Reserve cut rates aggressively ?
People should be wary of commentators who purport to explain `` why '' a currency 's exchange rate is doing what it is doing .
Second , exporters who blame the current level of the Euro for their difficulties should wake up to reality . The current level of the Euro makes prices on both sides of the Atlantic relatively similar .
If an exporting firm is only profitable when the Euro falls to $ 0.80 or $ 0.90 , it better start increasing productivity fast if it is to survive with the Euro back up at $ 1.17 .
For many years Germany and Japan dominated world exports , and at the time both the yen and the Deutsche Mark were among the `` strongest '' currencies in the world .
It was innovation , and high productivity , not a weak currency , that enabled German and Japanese goods to conquer the world .
The US economy was flying in the 1990s , when the dollar was strong .
As was true for Germany and the Deutsche Mark and remains true for Japan and the yen , a strong dollar has not historically caused weak US growth .
But most of these exports go to other Euro-zone countries , and are thus unaffected by the level of the Euro .
Exports outside the Euro area claim only 15-16 % of Europe 's total output , and will be even less when -LRB- and if -RRB- Sweden and the UK join the Euro .
So commentators , policymakers , and businessmen should stop calling for the ECB to do something about the `` strong Euro . ''
Central bank intervention in the currency market is merely destabilizing , and therefore counter-productive .
The ECB was right to ignore the exchange rate when it fell to $ 0.80 , and it is right to ignore it today when it is close to $ 1.20 .
Most economists believe that central banks should only target inflation , which means cutting interest rates only when the economy slows down and inflation falls -- which is precisely what the ECB has been doing .
The bottom line is that Europeans should worry and talk less about the Euro exchange rate , and spend the time they save trying to address their real problems : low productivity , market rigidities , fiscal polices constrained by the Stability Pact , and bankrupt pension systems .
Europe 's economic policymakers have enough problems on their plate . They should let the currency markets take care of the Euro\/dollar exchange rate .
The Dangers of Gray Power
The Dangers of Gray Power
With rare bipartisan agreement , the Bush administration is proposing a substantial increase in benefits for the elderly .
The proposed reforms may cost US taxpayers more than President Bush 's massive tax cut of 2001 , and one that implies a very significant redistribution from America 's young to its old .
But while many observers have pointed out the risks associated with Bush 's tax cuts , and the gaping deficits that have followed , few seem worried about the added deficits that will arise from this gift to the old .
What is happening in America is but more evidence of the vast power exercised by the elderly in our societies .
Similar moves are afoot throughout Europe , where the generosity of state-sponsored pension plans has become unsustainable , but reforming the system is almost impossible politically .
The rise of pensioners ' political power results from a multiplicity of factors .
The first is simply that in every industrial society , people are living longer lives and having fewer children .
Combine this with the generous retirement rules that were designed in the 1970 's , when the post-war baby-boomers were just about to join the labor market and the welfare state seemed to be free of budget constraints , and you create an entitlement that no one wants to tinker with .
The second factor empowering the pensioners ' lobby is that the old are , on average , richer than the young , simply because they have been around longer and so have had more time to accumulate wealth .
Being richer , they can provide more financial support to parties and politicians who will defend their interests than the young , who might want to push for pension reform .
Finally , pensioners have time in their hands , which they dedicate to organize political activities in their own interest .
Two examples : many trade union leaders in Italy are retirees , and retirees account for the largest proportion of the members of the most powerful and militant union , the CGIL .
In the US , retirees tend to vote more than the young .
Indeed , their power in America was perhaps best symbolized by the fact that a relatively few elderly men and women in Florida decided the last Presidential election !
All of this generates a vicious circle : the stronger the political power of pensioners and of older workers , the greater the pressure on government to shorten working lives and increase pension benefits .
This in turn raises the share of voters who are dependent on pensions , and thus the political power of retirees .
In a recent article , Vincenzo Galasso and Paola Profeta from Bocconi university in Milan show that , in Italy , this nexus is now the major obstacle to pension reform .
As time passes , the political support for reform dwindles , at least until the system blows up .
Another aspect that makes reforms difficult is that public pensions systems redistribute income from the rich to the poor because these systems are typically structured as `` defined benefits '' systems .
Pensions are linked to final wages rather than to the actual contribution made by the worker over his or her lifetime .
The extent of this redistribution varies from one country to another , but it is present throughout the OECD , including in the US .
Within the anti-reform coalition , those who favor redistribution , typically young and on the political left , thus often join retirees and older workers .
The result is an extremely powerful political movement that extends from left to right , and includes young and old alike .
The clear losers are young workers , and the future generations who will face the high tax burdens necessary to pay retirees their promised benefits .
The redistribution implicit in many pension systems is often far from `` clean . ''
Many systems entail politically motivated privileges for powerful lobbies .
In Brazil , the pension plan of private sector workers runs a small surplus , but that of civil servants runs an enormous deficit , equivalent to of 4.5 % of Brazil 's GDP .
It is encouraging that the French government eventually prevailed , and interesting how this happened .
After weeks of paralyzing strikes , Prime Minister Raffarin 's government began a campaign to convince voters that the reform was simply removing the privileges of a small minority .
The point sold well and civil servants found themselves isolated .
Of course , given the political risks , governments should not wait for confrontation with pensioners .
Officials can take two obvious steps to avoid it altogether .
First , increase the age of retirement .
This has two obvious benefits : it cuts the overall cost of the system by shrinking the number of retirees , and thus weakens the constituency that opposes reform .
Second , eliminate the redistribution implicit in the system .
Any redistribution , indeed , should be transparent , and take place via taxation and non pension-related transfers .
Of course , it is easy to understand why this does not happen : when redistribution is transparent , those who pay for it can complain .
When redistribution takes place via the pension system , it is paid for by unborn generations , who have no voice in the next election .
In the meantime , one can only suggest to our grandparents that they compensate their grandchildren by leaving them generous private bequests along with high tax burdens .
Reforming Europe from Below
Reforming Europe from Below
Look at European history for the past 25 years , and you see that from the late 1970 's to the early 1990 's the continent was plagued by macroeconomic instability , high unemployment , over-regulated markets -- including , importantly , financial markets -- unregulated monopolies , and inefficient state-run industries .
Over the past decade Europe has made important progress in restoring macroeconomic stability , but it has been less successful in enacting the micro-level reforms that are necessary to deregulate markets and improve their efficiency .
Is there a lesson in this for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe as they prepare to join the EU ?
High inflation and mounting public debt generated a feeling of `` crisis '' in the early 1990 's in some EU countries : when one 's house is on fire , the costs of doing nothing are too large to continue sitting back and doing nothing .
It took the exchange rate crisis of 1992 , for instance , to make Italy 's leaders realize that something had to be done about the country 's public finance mess .
The fear of being left out of the euro did the rest , by creating a political consensus in favor of taking the right and necessary steps .
Today , Europe 's economic house is no longer on fire .
So it has become much harder to break the back of special interests in order to liberalize markets and improve economic efficiency .
Just this past June , for example , France went through a 1968-style month of strikes and street protests only to implement minor pension reforms : the elimination of a few special privileges enjoyed by public sector employees .
In a sense such pusillanimous reforms are the outcome of Europe having become a more `` normal '' place .
Europe simply could not afford the failure of the euro project , so it 's leaders did what was necessary .
But no one , it seems , will stop this rich continent from living with slow growth , high unemployment , and inefficient markets .
There is no `` crisis '' associated with that choice -- just slow decline .
The Maastricht convergence criteria that led to the euro 's creation worked because they were imposed by a multinational agreement and were monitored multinationally .
More importantly , the `` punishment '' for not complying was clear , strong , and certain : exclusion from the monetary union .
None of that threatens Europe today .
So member states have precious little incentive to continue the reform process ?
But could something like the Maastricht process be used to implement structural reform ?
In a sense , such a process is already at work .
One mechanism that has often been effective at reining in powerful special interests in individual EU states , and thus at implementing structural reforms , is action by the European Commission .
France decided to permit a very mild opening of its domestic electricity market the day before the start of formal proceedings against France at the European Court of Justice for infringement of an EU directive .
Italy ended 70 years of active involvement by the state in industry thanks to the determination of the EU competition commissioners , Karel van Miert and his successor , Mario Monti .
Obviously the European Commission can play a positive role only if it embraces a stance in favor of liberalizing markets and does not fall into the trap of focusing on coordinating national regulation throughout the Union .
Regulation of markets does need to be coordinated ; but it also needs to be eliminated in many cases .
Consider Europe 's financial markets , which provide an alternative way to break the reform deadlock .
In the old Europe , with fragmented financial markets , Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder 's request that Mannesmann remain a German company in the face of a -LRB- successful -RRB- takeover bid by Vodaphone was tantamount to his following an order by the company 's mostly German shareholders .
As it turned out , such action no longer works in a world in which European companies are exposed to the scrutiny of international investors .
European financial markets were , and to some extent still are , dominated by a few large banks .
When the euro was launched banks in Europe accounted for some 80 % of total firm financing , as compared to 30 % in the US .
Banks are often less prepared to finance a risky , but possibly bright idea .
As lenders , they are also less efficient at monitoring firms than shareholders are .
Before the advent of the euro , local markets were small and illiquid .
The development of modern , highly liquid financial markets has been one of the main benefits of the euro : in a few years , for instance , bank lending in Germany fell from 74 % to 32 % of the total funds raised by large German companies .
In Italy the share of bank lending as a percent of the total funds raised by big Italian companies fell from 75 % to 50 % -- the difference being made up mostly by emissions of corporate bonds .
The lesson for new member countries from the East is clear : once you are in the Union , the outside pressure to reform decreases : the impetus to reform must be found at home .
Reforms aimed at deregulating financial markets should be the priority .
Capitalism 's High Noon
Capitalism 's High Noon
Last year 's Vivendi and this year 's Parmalat scandals have seen to that .
Europe , like America - indeed , like the entire capitalist world - must now become more hawkish in demanding prosecution and punishment of bosses who loot their companies .
American prosecutors in the Enron case have made important progress lately , with some important crooks , like Andrew Fastow , offering both guilty pleas and a willingness to testify against their former colleagues .
Mr. Fastow will go to jail for ten years ; those he testifies against will face even longer sentences .
Italian prosecutors seem zealous to make those who looted Parmalat pay a similar price .
But these cases go beyond the companies robbed and the shareholders betrayed .
What is at stake is no less than the perception of the fairness of the market and political support everywhere for market-oriented policies .
Capitalist economies produce inequality , often large ones .
Up to a point , and to the extent that income differences are due to differences in ability , effort , investment in education , etc. , they are necessary to providing the correct incentives to invest , work , innovate , and grow .
But the more tainted the market 's reputation for fairness , the more average citizens will see income differences merely as the result of corruption , illegal activities , connections with public officials , and so on . This will increase demands for more regulation and heavy government involvement in the economy , so as to bring unruly and untrustworthy capitalists under greater control .
Moreover , the more that wealth accumulation is viewed as `` unfair '' -LRB- i.e. , the result of corruption and illegality -RRB- , the more pressure for stiff taxation of `` ill-gotten gains '' will mount .
If any of these populist measures would make markets fairer and better functioning , we would say , `` So be it . ''
Unfortunately , reacting to corrupt businessmen in this way sets in motion a vicious circle : more regulation may lead to even more corruption in order to avoid it ; higher taxes on wealth will bring about even more tax evasion , making the system even more tainted .
Sadly , nowadays , things as disparate as highly paid executives , the Enron and Parmalat scandals , contested mergers and acquisitions , stock market volatility , `` junk bonds , '' and asset-price bubbles are all lumped together under the snide heading `` cowboy capitalism . ''
Europeans are particularly prone to see things this way - and to see a powerful government as the sheriff to keep the cowboys from shooting up the town .
This is especially worrisome because Europe has recently begun moving in the right direction by deregulating its markets .
With political support for these changes still shaky , the risk is that opponents may use Parmalat , Enron , Vivendi , and other cases as an excuse to reverse the process .
In many developing countries , weak regulators and a widespread perception of corruption often stand in the way of pro-market reforms ; the left -LRB- populist or otherwise -RRB- can credibly argue that capitalism is `` corrupt '' and so must be taken under the wing of the government .
This is a big reason why market capitalism has such a hard time taking root in the developing word .
If capitalists are corrupt , how can you convince a poor peasant to believe in the market economy ?
He will vote for populist policies .
The result is even more corruption and less growth in a sort of `` corruption-induced '' poverty trap .
The Parmalat scandal may have been a blow to global capitalism , but in Italy it is hoped that it might sound the death knell for an economic system traditionally based much more on `` connections '' amongst private groups - and between these groups and the public sector - than on competitive markets .
For Italy , the obvious solution is to strengthen the country 's investigative and financial institutions , and improve the design of regulatory agencies , particularly the quality of their personnel .
This , however , will not happen overnight , and in the meantime the demand for more regulation may result in a structure that is heavy , ineffective , and in the end impedes , rather than corrects , market forces .
Supervision inside Italian firms should be strengthened by making sure that a sufficient number of non-executive directors sit on the boards of public companies .
A single independent director would probably have been enough to blow the whistle at Parmalat : there were none on its board .
Similarly , it might help to have accounting firms be selected by minority shareholders or paid by the stock exchange , rather than by a company itself .
Here , even the recent changes in the US have not gone far enough : they prevent accounting firms from also serving as advisors to a firm , but they still leave the decision about remunerating the accountants in the hands of the company , thus creating a perverse incentive to play fast and loose with financial reporting .
It is surprising that while the Italian government is busy redesigning the regulatory and supervisory structure of the country 's financial institutions and financial markets , nothing is being said about independent directors and accounting firms .
After all , good sheriffs need active citizens to be in their posses and to serve on juries .
Clean capitalism needs the same sort of widespread engagement .
Competition policy is the European Union 's biggest success . The reason is simple : decisions in this area have been removed from the jurisdiction of individual nations , thus making them more difficult to influence .
The result is that the many lobbies that oppose increased competition , or fight to protect state aid , have been hugely weakened .
But has the anti-trust fight gone too far ?
The executive powers that the European Commission enjoys over competition policy allow it to circumvent the national vetoes and compromises that are common in other areas . For example , implementation of rules governing the single market are subject to a unanimity rule , or at the very least a qualified majority of member states , with the result that progress is usually slow .
The European Commission recently lost much of its standing in the eyes of ordinary Europeans with the vitriolic fights between the Council and the Commission over the defunct Stability Pact and the failure to approve the draft constitution .
So it is vital that the Commission 's reputation in the area of competition policy shine because this reputation is the Union 's most precious capital ; this is no time to waste it .
However , excessive zeal and pursuit of cases with dubious economic justification , as has sometimes happened in merger cases , can do serious damage .
Those who argue for the protection of state aid , for instance , immediately use an unfortunate decision in the merger area : see , they say , how stupid the Commission is at economics !
Examples of this include the decisions to veto the merger between Airtours and First Choice , and also between Tetra Laval and Sidel - decisions that where based on dubious arguments and were eventually reversed by the European Court of Justice , with serious damage to the Commission 's credibility .
The recent decision to fine Ryanair , Europe 's main budget airline , for its arrangement with local officials in using Charleroi as its main airport in Belgium , is another example of an unfortunate decision that could undermine the Commission 's reputation .
Here are the facts : Charleroi was a small dusty airport with less than 200,000 passengers per year .
Ryanair proposed a deal : the airport forgoes its landing fees , and in exchange Ryanair flies in two million people per year .
The deal was signed and almost everybody was happy : passengers who fly cheaply ; the airport , where the number of shops increased along with the number of passengers ; the local community , where new jobs were created .
The unhappy exceptions , of course , were the big airlines that charge ten times as much as Ryanair and were losing business .
But Charleroi is state-owned .
State-owned , said Brussels ?
Then foregoing landing fees is tantamount to giving Ryanair state aid - the presumption being that the lost revenue must be coming at the expense of Belgian taxpayers .
So the Commission asked Ryanair to pay back most of the forgone fees , and announced that it will review the airline 's terms of operation at other European airports as well .
The outcome may well be the demise of Ryanair .
Michael O'Leary , the CEO of Ryanair , is a visionary .
In an interview last summer , he depicted a world in which people would fly free and airlines would charge airports in exchange for the millions of passengers they deliver to their shops .
This is the best possible world for passengers , since nobody forces anyone to spend money in an airport ; people do it only because it is convenient .
Even leaving aside this vision , Ryanair succeeded in providing cheap fares in a European travel market that not long ago was prohibitively expensive .
Ryanair has been a champion of increasing competition in the airline industry , forcing other carriers to reduce fares .
Punishing this airline will only reduce competition in the airline industry , an outcome that , Mario Monti , the EU competition commissioner , and Loyola de Palacio , the EU transport commissioner , can not possibly want .
Obviously , one may object that if the Commission lowers its guard on state aid once , then `` everything may go . ''
So how can the Commission distinguish between cases ?
Our answer is that there should be a presumption that state aid to any industry or specific company must be subject to prohibition .
This simple principle should guide Commission competition decisions .
Only in exceptional cases can this presumption be overturned .
Ryanair is probably one of these exceptional cases .
After all , there was a far better solution than punishing the airline : force Belgium to privatise the airport .
Once private , Charleroi airport could sign any agreement it wishes , with Ryanair or any other airline .
Here , however , we hit a soft spot : European treaties protect competition , but are neutral vis-à-vis state ownership of companies .
Brussels can not force a member country to privatize : it can only force it to run a state-owned company as if it were a private corporation .
This is difficult , because getting rid of the implicit guarantee enjoyed by a state-owned company is virtually impossible .
Drafters of the next rendition of the European Constitution should take notice .
Our Unbalanced World
Our Unbalanced World
The search for a new Managing Director of the IMF provides a keen reminder of how unjust today 's international institutions are .
Created in the postwar world of 1945 , they reflect realities that have long ceased to exist .
The organization and allocation of power in the UN , the IMF , the World Bank , and the G7 meetings reflects a global equilibrium that disappeared long ago .
After WWII Germany and Japan were the defeated aggressors , the Soviet Union posed a major threat , and China was engulfed in a civil war that would bring Mao 's Communists to power .
Much of the so-called Third World was either recently independent , or remained colonies ; all of it was very poor .
There were 74 independent countries in the world in 1945 ; today there are 193 .
Outside of China , Cuba , and North Korea communism is popular only in West European cafés and a few American college campuses .
Germany is reunited and much of the Third World is growing faster than the First World , with computer software built in Bangalore and American graduate programs , including business schools , receiving thousands of application from smart Chinese students .
The whole world has turned upside down , and yet France and Britain , for example , retain permanent seats on the UN Security Council .
This made sense in 1945 ; it does not today .
Why France and Britain and not Germany or Japan , two much larger economies ?
Or India and Brazil , two huge countries ?
Does it really make sense that two European Union member countries hold a veto power on the Security Council while the Third World -LRB- outside of China -RRB- is completely unrepresented ?
The EU does not have a common foreign policy and it will not have one in the foreseeable future , but this is no reason to continue to provide a preference to France and Britain .
If Europe is really serious about a common foreign policy , does the current arrangement make any sense ?
True , France and Britain do have the best foreign services in Europe , but this is reversing cause and effect .
France and Britain maintain this capability because they continue to have foreign-policy relevance .
Europe 's over-representation extends beyond the Security Council .
While a European foreign policy does not exist , Europe has some sort of common economic policy : 12 of the 15 current members have adopted the euro as their currency and share a central bank .
Nevertheless Germany , France , Italy , and Britain hold four of the seven seats at the G7 meetings .
Indeed , the situation is even more absurd when G7 finance ministers meet : the central bank governors of France , Germany , and Italy still attend these meetings , even though their banks have been reduced to local branches of the European Central Bank , while the president of the ECB - these countries ' real monetary authority - is a mere `` invited guest . ''
Should n't there be only one seat for Europe ?
Of course , European leaders strongly oppose any such reform : they fear losing not only important opportunities to have their photographs taken , but real power as well .
But how much power they really wield in the G7 is debatable : America 's President , Secretaries of State and Treasury , and the Chairman of the US Federal Reserve almost certainly get their way more easily in a large , unwieldy group than they would in a smaller meeting where Europe spoke with a single voice .
The current search for a new IMF head continues this pattern .
The IMF Managing Director is a post reserved for a West European ; the Americans have the World Bank .
This division of jobs leaves out the developing countries , many of which are `` developing '' at a speed that will make them richer than Europe in per capita terms quite soon .
What about the one billion Indians or the 1.2 billion Chinese ?
Should n't one of them at least be considered for such a post ?
What about the hard working and fast-growing South Koreans ?
Why should they not be represented at the same level as Italy or France ?
What about Latin American success stories like Chile and perhaps Mexico or Brazil ?
The Europeans do n't even seem to care very much about the job .
After all , Horst Köhler , the IMF managing director , resigned from a job that commands the world 's attention to accept the nomination to become President of Germany , a ceremonial post with no power whatsoever , not even inside Germany .
The OECD is located in Paris , the UN 's Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome , and the list goes on . Simply put , Western Europe is overrepresented in international organizations , given its size in terms of GDP and even more so in terms of population .
It is thus not surprising that some Europeans - particularly the French - are so reluctant to reform the international organizations , even in terms of cutting waste and inefficiency at the UN .
After all , might not someone then suggest that the first step in such a reform is to reduce Europe to a single seat on the Security Council ?
Europe is being myopic .
A single seat - at the UN , the IMF , or the World Bank - would elevate Europe to the same level as the US and would augment , rather than diminish , its global influence .
The over-representation of Western Europe and the under-representation of growing developing countries can not last .
Indeed , it is already creating tensions .
Obsolete dreams of grandeur should not be allowed to interfere with a realistic and fair distribution of power in the international arena .
Two demographic acids are corroding Continental Europe 's welfare states .
One is Europe 's aging population . The other is the flow of immigrants from soon-to-be new member countries in the European Union and from outside the union .
In our recent book Fighting Poverty in the US and Europe : A World of Difference , Edward Glaeser and I discuss why the welfare state is so much more generous in Europe than in the US .
One important explanation is the much larger racial heterogeneity to be found in the US relative to the more homogeneous Continental Western Europe .
Consider this : according to the World Value Survey , whereas 60 % of Americans believe that the poor are `` lazy , '' only 26 % of Europeans hold this belief .
Not surprisingly , those who adhere to such beliefs are more averse to redistribution and welfare , and evidence shows that in the US , those who express more `` anti-minority '' points of view are also more averse to redistribution and more likely to have less sympathy for the poor .
It seems easier for white middle class Americans to consider the poor less worthy of government support if they think of them as different .
To put it crudely , but candidly , indifference comes easy if the poor are assumed to be mostly `` black . ''
This is more difficult in Norway , where rich and poor are white , often blond and tall .
Much experimental and statistical evidence shows that individuals trust and associate more with others of the same race .
Precisely for this reason , political opportunists in the US have long used the race card to discredit welfare and redistribution , from the Jim Crow system that segregated blacks in the South before 1964 to the infamous Reagan-era charge about black `` welfare queens '' who drive Cadillacs .
Right wing white politicians , predisposed against taxes and redistribution , use the race issue to secure the votes of poor whites , who otherwise might vote differently on purely economic grounds .
Even more fundamentally , racial considerations also influence the nature of America 's political institutions .
In Europe , however , socialist and communist parties imposed electoral systems based on proportional representation precisely because they open the door to representatives of minorities -LRB- the communists and socialists themselves -RRB- .
The few American cities that introduced this system in the Progressive era , between 1910 and 1930 , soon abandoned it - or were forced to - in order to stop the election of black representatives .
Today the only US city that uses proportional representation is the leftist bastion of Cambridge Massachusetts .
Proportional representation is widely viewed as one factor that promotes the implementation of redistributive policies by providing a political voice to minorities .
Cross-country evidence shows that the size of public redistributive spending increases with the degree of proportionality in the electoral system .
States that are more racially heterogeneous have smaller redistributive programs , even controlling for their level of income .
Welfare is relatively plentiful in the overwhelmingly white states of the North and Northwest -LRB- Oregon and Minnesota , to cite two examples -RRB- and in some states in New England -LRB- such as Vermont -RRB- .
Continental Europe is becoming , and will become , more ethnically mixed as more newcomers from Eastern Europe and the developing world arrive .
Xenophobic parties are on the rise across Europe ; in some cases , they are in office .
Think of Jörg Haider and the late Pym Fortuyn , or , to a lesser extent , Italy 's Northern League .
It will not be long before even Europe 's more respectable conservative parties reach for rhetoric about `` foreigners coming here to feast off of our taxes . ''
Simply put , when middle-class Europeans begin to think that a good portion of the poor are recent immigrants , their ingrained belief in the virtue of the welfare state will begin to waver .
Even Europe 's leftist intelligentsia now associates crime and urban squalor with immigration .
The step from here to lamenting the high taxes spent on welfare for immigrants is a but a short one .
The first strategy is short sighted and the second odious .
I hope that the third one will win out , because it would mean relatively open borders , no discrimination , and less government intervention .
Not to worry : the European welfare state will remain more generous than the stingy American one , but it may become more manageable and less intrusive .
The fact that this will come about because of ethnic `` animosity '' is sad and depressing .
The silver lining is that the European welfare state does indeed need trimming !
Melting Pot or Economic Meltdown
Melting Pot or Economic Meltdown
Worried about an invasion of migrant workers from the new member states of Central and Eastern Europe , the old EU members have erected high barriers in order to prevent the flow .
Despite the open market rhetoric of the EU , for most citizens of the new member states free labor mobility will not be a reality for the next seven years at least .
This is a politically understandable but flawed policy .
One of the key achievements of the European Union is mobility of goods and inputs .
Without this , what kind of a union would the EU be ?
Otherwise , what , precisely , do the new countries get out of membership other than the nagging intrusions of the Brussels bureaucracy ?
Given the high hopes that preceded ascension to the EU , and the stingy attitude of the Union to its new members , it should not surprise anyone if an anti-European reaction soon starts to brew in these countries .
So the cure is as bad as the disease : discrimination against the new members creates political problems of its own for the Union .
The real question is whether there is a disease at all .
Should Western Europe really be worried about an enormous flow of new immigrants ?
According to An agenda for a growing Europe , a report published by Oxford University Press in 2004 for the European Commission , 250,000 to 450,000 workers will go West during the first one to two years , followed by around 100,000 to 200,000 annually thereafter .
Over the first decade , the cumulative number of migrants might amount to between 1.5 and four million , that is , 2.4 % to 5 % of the total population in the new member states - and a tiny fraction of the total population in the current Union .
Aging populations and lower fertility rates in the new member states might result in even smaller flows .
As Mircea Geoana , Romania 's bright young Minister of Foreign Affairs , recently put it : `` If the EU waits another seven or ten years before it opens up , the workers it will receive from my country will be the least qualified , peasants and individuals with low human capital : by then , the doctors , the architects and the engineers will all have migrated to the United States . ''
Indeed , this is precisely what happened with the Russians : the most qualified have already gone to the US . Europe has been unable to attract much more than a few disreputable oligarchs , who migrated to the French Riviera , and a handful of lively street singers .
Western Europe is increasingly inhabited by aging populations that have lost the incentive and enthusiasm to work hard , take risks , and be ambitious .
Without an inflow of new blood and new ideas , the old Continent 's economic future looks bleak .
Just look at the US : where would America be if it had introduced barriers to entry to various waves of new immigrants and remained confined to Anglo Saxon settlers ?
To be sure , managing a melting pot is not easy , and many of America 's social problems are related to difficult race relations .
But New York and Los Angeles , the two most ethnically diverse cities in the US , are also America 's leaders in business and in the arts . Nothing comes easy in this world : if the Union can not manage a multicultural society in Europe , then it ought to prepare itself for permanent stagnation .
So long as the Union 's borders remain closed , there is also a risk that foreign investment will fly over Western Europe and land in Central and Eastern Europe , where people are willing to work longer hours , market regulations are less intrusive , and human capital is relatively high , because Communist schools were good at technical training .
These countries have opened their markets to foreign investors - and foreign investors are responding eagerly .
Given Western Europe 's growing need for labor in the years ahead , the question is not whether to have immigration , but only where that immigration is going to come from .
Will it be the legal immigration of easily assimilated people from Central and Eastern Europe , or illegal immigration from the Maghreb ?
Europe on Holiday
Europe on Holiday
Currently , the average number of hours worked per person aged 15 to 25 each year in France and Germany is about 50 % lower than in the United States .
Other European countries -LRB- for example , Italy and Spain -RRB- fall somewhere between these poles .
Although some Americans always like to boast about their superior work ethic , this disparity in working hours between the US and Europe has not always existed .
Indeed , until the mid-1970 's , the number of hours worked on either side of the Atlantic was roughly the same .
From the mid-1970 's on , however , Americans continued working more or less the same number of hours , while Western Europeans began working less and less each year .
If Western Europe needs an explanation as to why its rate of economic growth is lagging behind the US , it need look no further .
The average number of working hours per person depends on a variety of factors :
? the level of participation in the labor force ;
? the number of vacation days workers have ;
? the number of hours worked in a `` normal '' week , i.e. , with no vacation .
Virtually all the difference between the US on one side and France and Germany on the other are due to the first two factors , each with roughly equal weight .
So , lower participation in the labor force explains half of the difference , and longer vacations for those who do work accounts for the other half .
The importance of vacation time should come as no surprise to anyone who has experienced Europe 's deserted cities in August , the three-week vacation `` bridges '' in April and May in France and Italy , the `` rush hours '' that take place every Friday at 2 PM in German cities , and crowded ski slopes in February due to winter school vacations .
But knowing `` how '' Europeans work less is one thing ; knowing `` why '' Europeans work less than Americans is another .
One view is that Americans are perceived -LRB- and like to see themselves -RRB- as Calvinist workaholics , whereas Europeans like to think that they know how to enjoy life 's pleasures .
As a European working in the US , I admit that I do take many more vacations than my American colleagues .
So there may be something in this `` cultural '' explanation .
But why did this start around 1973 ?
A second argument attributes the difference to income taxes , which , in fact , have increased significantly in Europe since the 1970 's , while in the US income taxes fell from the early 1980 's onward .
Income taxes certainly must affect willingness to work .
They may not change by much the number of hours worked by the main breadwinner in a family -LRB- typically a man -RRB- , but they do influence the participation of women in the labor force .
After all , why work , when your after-tax salary barely pays for childcare and household help ?
But even this is not a sufficient explanation , because studies of how the supply of labor responds to tax changes suggest that something else must explain the enormous gap between US and Europe , especially France and Germany .
For the age group over 50 , the structure of pension systems is clearly a major factor .
It was and remains much more profitable to retire earlier in Europe than in the US .
Why should a Frenchman or Italian in his early sixties work today , when in the 1990 's he could have retired in his mid-fifties with 80 % or more of his last working-age salary ?
For women , the retirement age in the mid-1990 's was even lower .
Public sector employees had even more advantages .
Nor is that all .
In the 1980 's and 1990 's , many European labor unions , in response to rising unemployment , adopted the policy of `` work less , work all . ''
In other words , they obtained shorter hours -LRB- i.e. , more vacations -RRB- in order to keep employment up .
The problem is that total compensation did not go down in proportion to the shorter hours , thus leading to an increase in pay per hour .
Lower productivity and higher unit labor costs eroded firms ' willingness to hire , leaving Europe with chronically higher unemployment than in the US .
Today 's debates about growth in Europe are full of buzz words like `` knowledge-based society , '' `` technological progress , '' and `` investment in education . ''
Europeans certainly need something to compensate for a short working life with many vacations .
But much of this discussion is merely a form of `` political correctness . '' It is more reassuring - and `` feels better '' - to tell Europeans that growth is sluggish because society is not sufficiently knowledge-based , rather than pointing to the trade-off between vacations and growth .
Europeans tend to prefer vacations over growth .
Personally , I love taking more and more vacations .
But I can not -LRB- and do not -RRB- then complain if my income does not grow faster and faster .
The Inevitability of Chinese Democracy
The Inevitability of Chinese Democracy
Fifteen years ago , Fang Hongin was protesting in Tienanmen Square .
A few years ago , in Beijing , he ran one of China 's most popular TV shows , each week testing the limits of the authorities ' indulgence .
Today , he runs Dragon TV , Shanghai 's leading station , and advertisements featuring him hang from the city 's skyscrapers .
Hu Shuli belongs to the same generation : the journalist whom the Economist magazine calls `` China 's most dangerous woman , '' moved from her first job , with the Party press , to editing Caijng , a business magazine that runs stories on corruption , exposing businessmen and public officials .
It would be a mistake , however , to interpret these experiments with a free press as signs that democracy in China is near .
The Party allows Caijng to expose corruption because this helps it to stop China 's most serious disease .
`` The first civil right is getting out of poverty , '' says Yongtu Long , one of China 's WTO negotiators .
`` In 15 years , we got 200 million people out of poverty ; 700 million Chinese today have access to electricity , an unknown luxury 15 years ago .
This is why our priority is growth : everything else , frankly , is less important . ''
Growth , however , does only mean getting people out of poverty .
Twenty-five years ago , China had a more egalitarian society than Sweden ; today there is vast inequality between city and countryside , between the western provinces and those bordering the Pacific ocean , and within cities , which attract a constant flow of former peasants looking for jobs .
Indeed , China 's income distribution today looks more like that of Brazil than that of Sweden .
But more inequality also means more opportunities : becoming rich today in China remains very difficult , but it is no longer impossible - just walk into one of the pubs of downtown Shanghai .
Inequality can be accepted , but not if it is the fruit of corruption , and this remains China 's foremost social problem , which the Party has been unable to eradicate , despite Caijng 's exposés and the death penalty .
Can China really do without democracy ?
A few years ago , Fareed Zakaria , then an editor of Foreign Affairs , argued against the priority normally given to democracy , simply defined as the possibility of choosing political leaders through free elections .
The world is full of democracies , he argued , that routinely violate human rights .
`` Elections are of little use if democratically elected governments limit the freedom of the press and the independence of the judiciary . ''
`` There is certainly more freedom in Shanghai than in Moscow , '' says a professor from Tsinghua University in Beijing , echoing Zakaria .
She is probably right , although India reminds us that sometimes elections are a powerful and effective mechanism to correct the path a country has taken .
India 's economy is growing almost as fast as China 's , with a similar increase in inequality and , to some extent , corruption .
But Indian voters have turned against this model .
As a result , India 's economy is likely to slow .
It is hard to tell whether this is good or bad .
It is probably bad in the short run , but who knows about the longer term ?
The point is that questions such as , `` Are we creating too much inequality ? '' can not even be asked in China .
The upshot is that whenever a problem gets out of hand , the turnaround comes too late and is dramatic .
This is why China can not shelve the problem of its transition to democracy .
Democracy is not only a mechanism to help prevent strategic mistakes .
There is a more mundane reason why many , even within the Party , think that a democratic transition has become inevitable : the Party is simply losing control of the country .
Deng Xiaoping was the last Chinese leader to possess undisputed authority to decide on public policy .
Today , the Party 's political bureau has more than 20 members and each resolution requires unanimity .
More important decisions require an even larger consensus , involving up to 3,000 people .
For example , the Party 's main current activity is drafting the documents that will be approved at the next congress , scheduled for the autumn of 2007 .
The difference between the economy 's pace and that of the Party means that the country increasingly runs on its own .
As in the past , when a dynasty weakens , the provinces make their own decisions .
Even slowing the economy is hard : lacking an efficient financial system , credit growth must be controlled directly through banks .
But the director of the Guangzhou office of China Construction Bank , China 's largest , consults with the party leader of his province before executing the directives he receives from the bank 's head office in Beijing .
Considering these difficulties , some inside the Party admit that `` there is only one way forward : let someone be in charge , no matter how she or he is chosen , even through an election , provided effective decision-making is restored . ''
So China 's democratic transition may be closer than anyone realizes .
But if it happens , it will not result from grassroots democratic experiments in towns and villages ; rather , it will be an elite-driven transition , careful to preserve the government 's control .
This is the only condition under which the People 's Liberation Army and the all-powerful Military Commission will accept democratization .
Politicizing EU Competition Policy
Politicizing EU Competition Policy
The new European Commission has been named .
What should be its primary goals ?
The Commission was originally created as a technocratic body relatively independent of either national or supranational control - correctly so , given its mandate .
The Commission works best when it sticks to this role .
Think of the excellent work it has done in the area of competition policy : breaking up cartels and stopping state aid , even when it comes in disguised forms , such as government guarantees on company debt .
The lesson is that Commissioners should focus on their specific tasks , bearing in mind the interests of the EU rather than those of their country of origin .
Mario Monti , the successful Commissioner for Competition , happened to be Italian , but nobody ever accused him of pursuing an `` Italian agenda . ''
In fact , his fight against state aid clashed with normal Italian practice .
An innovation by current President Romano Prodi 's Commission helped .
Prodi 's Commission decided to send Commissioners `` into the field '' : their offices were no longer next to the President 's office , but located in the department for which each was responsible .
This forced Commissioners to concentrate on their jobs and keep an eye on the all-powerful director-generals and their bureaucracies ; there was little time left for `` big picture '' politics .
But the new commission that Durao Barroso , Portugal 's former Prime Minister , has appointed risks becoming imprisoned by the bureaucracy again .
For one thing , Barroso has decided to bring his Commissioners back into the President 's office .
This means less control and direct oversight of the bureaucracy , and an increased incentive to spend the day thinking up big plans rather than concentrating on targeted improvements .
The problem is aggravated by the composition of the new Commission . There will be 25 Commissioners , one for each EU member country , whereas previously big countries had two and small countries one .
Moreover , the new Commissioners will include three former prime ministers , five former foreign ministers , and three former finance ministers - all heavyweight people with big political agendas at home .
Consider Italy , where Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi replaced Mario Monti , the Commission 's most successful and effective member , with a politician enmeshed in the arcane games of Italian party politics .
Berlusconi 's interest is clear : he wants someone he can call and ask to look after Italy 's interests - be it a forbidden government loan to Alitalia or some other favor .
There is also a Machiavellian explanation for the replacement of Monti .
It is no secret that he irritated France and Germany .
His latest decision was to force France Telecom to pay back with interest a loan granted years ago by the French government , in violation of EU rules on state aid .
Germany never really accepted Monti 's decision to bar government guarantees on the balance sheets of its Landesbanken , the powerful regional banks .
The German government is also worried by the Commission 's resolution to question the `` Volkswagen law . ''
That law prevents any shareholder who controls more than 20 % of voting shares in Volkswagenwerk GmbH -LRB- VW -RRB- from casting more than 20 % of the votes in a shareholders ' meeting .
It also decrees that a majority of more than 80 % of shareholder votes is required for important decisions in the company .
The Volkswagen law also deters private investors from acquiring shares in the company , despite the principle of free capital mobility within the EU .
We do not know whether Chancellor Gerhard Schröder and\/or President Jacques Chirac called Berlusconi to suggest that he find a new Italian Commissioner .
Maybe they did , and maybe they did n't : one can not know , especially at a time when Italy may need the full support of Chirac and Shröder as it tries to bail out Alitalia .
The bottom line is that with the new Commission members focused on their domestic political agendas , Durao Barroso 's team will do less effectively what the Commission used to do well .
At the same time , to the extent that the Commission becomes less a body of technocrats and more a political body , the so-called `` democratic deficit '' will increasingly become a problem .
The root cause of the problem is the new European constitution .
This , together with the rule that all decisions , even in the area of state aid , must be approved by a majority of Commissioners , suggests that the Commission is set to become much more lenient on state aid and competition policy .
Is the European Union imploding ?
Is the European Union imploding ?
The prospect of being accepted into the EU provided the nations of Eastern and Central Europe with a strong incentive to achieve fiscal balance - a process somewhat similar to what happened in Western Europe at the time the euro was launched .
In both cases , however , after initial progress , countries have shown clear signs of political `` fatigue '' : in the euro area , the Stability Pact has imploded ; throughout Eastern Europe , budget deficits have started to rise .
In the Czech Republic last year , the budget deficit jumped to 13 % of GDP , a threefold increase since 1999 .
In Hungary the budget deficit is widening again , after narrowing to 4 % of GDP in 2001 .
Malta , too , has a deficit close to 10 % of GDP , up four percentage points since 2001 .
Only the Baltic countries seem able to maintain sound fiscal policies .
In many ways , this is not surprising : once politicians no longer face annual EU progress reports - and the threat of exclusion - fiscal relaxation becomes much less costly .
At the same time , the big euro area members -LRB- France and Germany -RRB- do not have a leg to stand on to criticize other countries ' fiscal policies , so there are virtually no international constraints on EU countries ' budget deficits .
Perhaps more surprising is the apparent political backlash against the governments that have led countries into the EU .
Once again the similarity with what happened in Western Europe at the time of the euro 's implementation is striking .
The government of Romano Prodi , having managed against all the odds to get Italy into Europe 's monetary union , fell three months later .
The Czech Republic , Poland , and Hungary have each endured a government crisis since EU accession .
Throughout Central and Eastern Europe , the EU is not as popular as it used to be .
Voter turnout in the European Parliament elections in June was embarrassingly low in the new accession countries , ranging from just 17 % in Slovakia to 38.5 % in Hungary .
Participating in their first-ever EU election , citizens in these countries turned out at a rate not only well below the European average -LRB- about 45 % -RRB- , but even below the UK average .
The reasons are twofold . Accession countries felt that they were asked to make major fiscal adjustments in order to be accepted into the EU .
Regardless of whether such policies were in the long-term interest of these countries , in the short run they were politically costly .
This `` adjustment fatigue , '' a term coined to describe the experience of Latin American countries to economic liberalization in the 1990 's , is now coupled with the feeling that the EU is not such a great bargain after all .
Perhaps most visible has been Western European countries ' eagerness to protect their labor markets against migration from Central and Eastern Europe - a sticking point that always comes up in every meeting between politicians from the West and the East .
Little wonder , then , that voters in Central and Eastern Europe now feel that they got a poor bargain from the governments that brought them in : belt tightening , labor market restrictions , and the notorious barrage of EU regulation .
The result has been a reaction against these governments and a lack of public interest in EU affairs .
So , after all the celebrations of European enlargement , we are left with a predictable set of problems : a `` union '' of countries with very different views on everything -LRB- from foreign policy to labor market policies -RRB- and different economic interests ; widespread disillusionment among voters in the new member states ; a constitutional process whose future is uncertain ; and all the usual political wrangling in Brussels between countries seeking to get as much power as possible .
The Long Decline of Western Europe ?
The Long Decline of Western Europe ?
It 's election season in Germany , France and Italy , so the time for structural reforms is over .
Paradoxically , this could be good news for those who think that Europe should start contributing to world growth by expanding domestic demand .
In fact , the current wisdom has it that the reason why France recently grew twice as fast as Germany is that French consumers have stopped worrying about social reforms .
As soon as French Finance Minister Nicolas Sarkozy decided to leave the government and start campaigning for the presidency , incumbent President Jacques Chirac abandoned all plans for reforms that might antagonize voters .
So health reform or even partial pension reform must wait a few years .
At the same time , a recent `` white paper '' produced by a working group headed by the IMF 's former boss , Michel Camdessus , which was charged with proposing the type of structural reforms needed to achieve growth , was received with the usual outcry from trade unions .
Most of its reasonable proposals will soon become another example of forgotten good intentions .
Back to business as usual in France .
German households , on the other hand , according to a recent poll published in the influential daily , Die Welt , are in a more sober mood : most plan on cutting down their vacation travel -- which , obviously , does not mean that they will work more ; they will just spend some of the many weeks of their paid leisure at home -- and postponing large item purchases .
Why ?
They are worried by the talk of pension reform , changes in the health system , and new eligibility rules for unemployment benefits .
To be sure , their mood may soon turn brighter : Chancellor Schröder is also preparing for re-election .
Accordingly , references to the need for pushing ahead with reforms have disappeared from his speeches .
As a result , perhaps the long-awaited turnaround in German consumption -- which has been flat for the good part of a decade -- is about to happen .
In Italy , Prime Minister Berlusconi waited three and a half years before deciding to deliver on his main electoral promise of a tax cut .
But real tax cuts also mean spending cuts and , as elections loom barely a year from now , it is too late .
Concerned that cutting spending might lose him votes , Berlusconi is proposing a tax cut of less that 0.3 % of GDP -- and one that is partly to be financed by other levies .
If Germans are depressed , Italians are in a coma .
Europeans do n't really want reforms , and politicians are very aware of this .
Or , to put it differently , special interests have become so powerful and entrenched that any attempt at reform brings out a powerful lobby against it .
So politicians on the campaign trail promise the impossible : reforms that will produce instant prosperity at no cost to anyone .
When -- surprise , surprise ! -- this turns out to be impossible , they give up on reform altogether .
In the meantime , they do serious damage because Europeans are so worried about the possibility of reform that the mere possibility of such reforms actually being enacted plunges them into a funk .
In fact , there are two problems with all this talk and little or no real action on structural reforms .
First , it makes consumers anxious and depresses demand .
Second , it leaves time for anti-reform lobbies to organize and prevent any progress toward completion of the reform effort .
A politically more successful plan would be to adopt the `` big bang '' approach : implement quickly a broad set of reforms that will break the opposition of special interests and leave enough time before the next election for the benefits of reform to be felt by voters .
When consumers see the benefits of market deregulation , for example , perhaps they will feel compensated for having to work longer for their retirement .
But no European politician on the horizon is likely to take this approach .
Does this mean that Europe -- at least continental Western Europe -- is doomed ?
Not necessarily .
Germany , France , and Italy are rich countries .
Even without reforms , they will be able to afford a civilized form of life for many years to come .
To be sure , eventually they will become poor relative to other , faster growing economies .
But after all , it took Argentina nearly a century of mismanagement to go from almost the top of per capita income to its relative poverty today .
Jose Bove Against the Poor
Jose Bove Against the Poor
Support for increased foreign aid , debt relief and debt forgiveness comes from all sides .
From rock stars , to `` anti-globalists , '' to religious organizations , to various advocates for developing countries , to the UN , the calls are becoming deafening .
The `` story '' promoted by the pro-aid movement is simple and appealing .
Global differences in income per capita are too extreme ; globalization is increasing income inequality ; the poor are becoming progressively poorer and many starve in order to pay their debt .
So more aid is needed , and more debt forgiveness , because the world 's rich become rich only at the expense of the world 's poor .
Aid and debt forgiveness will lift poor countries out of poverty
This story is almost completely wrong .
The only part that is true is that differences in per capita income are extreme .
All the rest is false .
Globalization is not responsible for third world poverty .
There is not one shred of evidence showing that more openness to trade increases poverty , but anti-globalists do not let facts interfere with their ideology .
More trade makes both sides of a transaction wealthier .
Even if globalization did increase inequality - a big if - since nobody has shown it convincingly , it still reduces poverty .
That is , it increases the income of both the poor and the rich who trade - more so the rich , of course , yet the poor gain too .
The anti-global alternative is to make both sides poorer .
Inequality may be lower , perhaps , but poverty higher .
What 's appealing about that ?
It is not true that poor countries have become poorer .
Many examples exist of countries that lifted themselves out of poverty , from South Korea to Costa Rica to Botswana .
Others squandered the immense wealth of natural resources , say Nigeria or Venezuela , the latter , incidentally , recently adopting protectionist policies .
There is no evidence that increasing foreign aid to governments in developing countries improves their economic performance and lifts them out of poverty permanently .
In fact , more aid is likely to increase corruption , because it augments the amount of resources over which elites fight .
The same goes for debt forgiveness : it only encourages countries to borrow more , often for the benefit of local elites .
A recent widely cited book by William Easterly - a former economist at the World Bank and an expert on aid and development - provides a mountain of shocking stories about local elites squandering foreign assistance .
The pro-aid coalition should read it carefully .
Those who really care about reducing poverty should place blame where it belongs : with governments and bureaucracies in many developing countries , especially in Africa and Latin America .
Traditionally , instead , foreign aid paid no attention to the virtues of the receiving countries and did not discriminate in favor of `` good governments . ''
Donors have typically favored their former colonies , irrespectively of the nature of their regimes .
One of the worst offenders here is France .
Statistical evidence shows that a hypothetical former colony of France , following hideous policies , with dictatorial and objectionable regimes , would receive much more aid from France than a non-former colony struggling and trying to adopt decent polices .
In other words , France gives almost exclusively to its former colonies , irrespective of how bad their regimes are .
Aid given by the US has been overly influenced by Middle East politics and , previously , by the Cold War .
Political alliances , indeed , are often more important than the quality of the receiving countries policies as a determinant of the direction of aid giving .
The only donors that directed their aid reasonably well are the Scandinavian countries , whose aid giving is the highest in per capita terms but small as a percentage of the total .
One of the reasons is that these countries did not have colonies and political alliances to support .
Before providing more aid or debt forgiveness two conditions need to be met .
One is `` institutional conditionality : '' only governments that show serious progress in reducing inefficiency , robbery of public property and corruption , should receive aid .
Reasonable ways to measure corruption do exist ; we know which countries are more corrupt than others .
This evidence should be used more aggressively by donors to discriminate amongst receivers .
Unfortunately , in most cases the poorest countries , where aid is most needed , are also the most corrupt .
So a second condition must be applied : in such cases aid flow should be kept completely out of public channels and administered by non-local groups un-associated with local elites and governments .
Finally , other rich country policies may be much more beneficial than aid .
The main change should be stopping agricultural protection for rich country farmers .
The worst enemies of poor countries are farmers in rich countries .
Defeating the lobby of French farmers that strangles reform of the EU common agricultural policy should be the top priority of Europe 's pro-poor coalition .
Instead , anti-globalists care more about the charm of French agricultural towns threatened by globalization , that is , by the agriculture of struggling poor countries .
Latin America 's Never-Ending Story
Latin America 's Never-Ending Story
Latin America is in deep trouble and the usual suspects -LRB- the IMF , the US Treasury -RRB- have come to the rescue .
Thirty years of macroeconomic upheaval in Latin America can be boiled down to a simple lesson : governments throughout the region are too large compared with their ability to raise revenue through normal types of taxation .
Until this vital issue is solved , crises will be the norm , because the fundamental economic choice these countries face will continue to be one between raising revenue through inflation or letting debt grow .
The typical cycle -- Argentina offers a perfect example -- is one where inflation is allowed to rise for a period .
With this , tax receipts grow while debt remains stable . But over time , people learn to live with high inflation and insulate the economy from its effects , thus reducing the revenues gained by the `` inflation tax . ''
At this point , government revenues fall , the benefits from high inflation vanish , and political support for stabilization consolidates .
Stabilization is typically followed by a short honeymoon .
Eventually , however , with inflation lowered and high levels of public spending unchanged , debt starts to grow again . A new crisis beckons .
The exchange rate is devalued . Some debts are repudiated and high inflation rates -LRB- and the inflation tax -RRB- return , both of which help balance the budget .
Over the 1990s , Argentina tried to tie its hands against such policies by instituting a currency board .
Instead , Argentina never balanced its budget , not even the budget net of interest payments on its debt .
Throughout these macroeconomic cycles poverty fluctuates .
Across South America there is an almost perfect correlation between the revenue gained from the inflation tax and various measures of poverty , because the poor are the least able to protect themselves from the inflation tax .
In Argentina , during the stabilization of the early 1990 's , when inflation fell from 1000 % per month to zero in a few weeks , the number of poor people was cut in half .
Contrary to what critics of the IMF , such as Joe Stiglitz , say , abandoning the `` Washington Consensus '' will hurt the poor .
In his recent vitriolic attacks on the IMF Stiglitz implied that he cares for the poor while the IMF does not .
Well , the data contradicts him : using policies that he directly or indirectly advocates - such as using deficits first and inflation later to solve fiscal problems - is especially bad for the poor .
Raising `` normal '' tax revenue remains an unrealistic option in most Latin American countries . What prevents normal taxation is lax tax enforcement , due to corrupt public administrations and a bourgeoisie with a well-developed culture of tax evasion .
Latin America 's rich and middle classes are particularly adept at shifting their wealth to tax havens at the slightest sign that tax collection may become tougher .
Take Brazil . Brazil has been more successful than Argentina in raising tax revenues .
Since its 1999 stabilization , the budget net of interest payments has constantly shown a surplus , now as high as 3.8 % of GDP .
This surplus , however , has not come from reduced spending , but from a set of inefficient and distortionary taxes , mostly on financial transactions .
The real issue in Brazil today is not whether a 3.8 % primary surplus is sufficient to keep the debt stable , but whether the economy can survive its burden of distortionary taxes .
Brazil 's government seems to lack the capacity to raise income taxes on the wealthy , which is outrageous given the country 's level of inequality .
The election of a populist politician in the coming presidential election will not change this .
No surprise , then , that financial markets are worried .
Domingo Cavallo , Menem 's economic guru , saw through all this , and concluded that the only way out was to reduce the size of government drastically .
If raising income taxes to the standard of industrial economies is impossible , then you must accept a lower level of public services : hence his radical privatization program of the early 1990 's , hence his assault on public sector employees and their European-style salaries and benefits .
Argentina 's currency board was set up to block recourse to that old easy option , the inflation tax .
It should be no surprise that the country found a way to rid itself of Cavallo and bring back its old populist politicians .
Latin America does not need financial engineering .
To argue that Latin America 's problems are due to IMF mistakes is superficial at best .
The problem of Latin America lies in its high level of government spending , the lack of a solid upper and middle class ready to pay taxes to support it , and the inability to produce politicians able to use tax revenues prudently and so break the cycle of populist demagoguery .
We plan to store this column carefully . Sadly , we will be able to use it again , with no change , at the next round of Latin American crises .
Mario Monti on Trial
Mario Monti on Trial
Mario Monti , the European Union 's Commissioner for Competition Policy , is often in the spotlight , usually to popular acclaim .
Over the years , he has won important victories limiting state aid to business , one of Europe 's most pernicious economic maladies .
With a competition case against software giant Microsoft seemingly in the offing , Commissioner Monti will need to rediscover his footing fast .
Within a period of just a few weeks , the European Court of Justice -LRB- to which private parties can appeal decisions made by the Commission -RRB- voided three of Monti 's decisions rejecting proposed corporate mergers .
While the two issues , state aid and private mergers , are in principle separate , losing repeatedly on one battlefield undermines Monti 's position elsewhere , particularly the battle against state aid .
The Court 's rulings against Monti 's decisions are devastating .
In the Schneider\/Legrand steel merger case , it cites `` several obvious errors , omissions and contradictions in the Commission 's economic reasoning '' as well as a `` procedural irregularity which constitutes an infringement of defense rights . ''
The Tetra Laval case saw the Court denounce Monti 's `` economic analysis of the immediate anti-competitive effects , '' which it said was `` based on insufficient evidence and some errors of assessment . ''
Finally , in the Airtours merger case , the Court rebuked the competition authorities for `` decisions that are vitiated by errors '' concerning issues that are `` fundamental to any determination of the question of the creation of a collective dominant position . ''
Worsening the injustice , in at least one case the Court 's decision came too late for the companies involved to go ahead with their plans .
These cases raise important questions about both the substance and procedures of the European Commission 's handling of competition policy .
Start with the substance . The Court 's verdicts leave the impression that competition policy in Europe is overly zealous .
That condemnation matters , because passing judgment on the trade-off between the efficiency gains to be had from any merger versus the threat to competition is a subtle matter , not an ideological one .
In the Airtours\/First Choice case , the Court ruled that the Commission failed to prove that the three leading tour operators , if merged , `` would have an incentive to cease competing with each other . '' The Court rejected the Commission 's conclusion that the merger would enable them `` to interpret each other 's business strategies more easily and to adopt those strategies themselves . ''
Moreover , the Commission `` failed to identify or demonstrate clearly '' how the merged operators would enforce any `` common policy . ''
Finally , the Commission `` underestimated '' competitors ' ability to react to `` any attempted restriction of capacity , '' either by increasing supply or by entering `` the relevant market quickly . ''
The Tetra Laval-Sidel case is particularly interesting because it shows the extent to Monti 's team tends to second-guess private companies .
The Competition Commission started from the premise that the current overlaps in the packaging markets will grow in the medium to long term .
It then concluded that Tetra Laval , from its strong dominant position in the carton container market , will probably pressure its current customers wishing to switch over to PET packaging to use equipment produced by Sidel when they make that switch .
The Court agreed , in principle , that the merger could allow such leveraging to occur , but it found that the Commission did not prove that the merged entity would have an incentive to use this possibility .
We are confident that Monti 's office could answer the Court 's criticisms and that reasonable people can disagree on the subtleties of whether these mergers threaten competition enough to be rejected .
But our point is different .
Rather than putting proposed mergers by private companies under the microscope , Commissioner Monti should focus on his other mandate : safeguarding against state intervention and state aid to companies .
In other words , Monti should think hard about redirecting his limited resources to the right battlefield .
In most European cities , taxi drivers are protected by limits on the number of licenses ; the number of notary publics in many countries is similarly restricted , and the price of their services-which are typically of little economic value , but inescapable under existing administrative procedures -- correspondingly high .
But , like the fight against subsidies to businesses , these are battles that are directed against state intervention , not private companies .
The question of procedures concerns constitutional design .
In the area of competition policy the Commission is , at least in the first instance , both prosecutor and judge .
The Commission is authorized to open a case against a proposed merger and to decide on it .
The parties involved can appeal to the European Court of Justice , but this takes time and a reversal of the Commission 's decision typically produces no more than a moral victory to one of the parties . The time of the merger may have come and gone , as was the case in the Airtours\/First Choice decision .
A division of responsibility between prosecutor and judge is a critical constitutional guarantee for private litigation .
Competition policy in the United States is based upon this principle . It is one that Europe would do well to put into practice .
Former President Giscard d'Estaing and the European Convention , please take note .
The Stealth Threat to World Trade
The Stealth Threat to World Trade
Threats to world trade come in many guises .
The usual suspects include protectionist barriers and militant anti-globalization protests of the type that derailed the `` Millennium Round '' of World Trade Organization -LRB- WTO -RRB- talks in Seattle last year .
Although these protests grab headlines , a new and perhaps even more insidious threat to world trade has quietly taken shape over recent years : so called `` open sectoralism , '' or the practice of negotiating access to foreign markets on a selective , industry-by-industry basis .
What this practice entails is that countries negotiate lower tariffs on some types of products but not on others .
Contrary to appearances , open sectoralism is not a first step to more comprehensive trade agreements .
Indeed , it may prevent wider agreements from being negotiated .
For even when successfully negotiated , sectoral agreements jeopardize economic efficiency and performance by protecting the least competitive industries because each country tries to open trade in areas where it is competitive .
No country likes to open its manufacturing dinosaurs to foreign competition .
The economic implications of such a stance , however , are perverse .
Imagine an America or Europe still stuck in the 1950s , with economies dependent on coal and steel , and textiles , and with no competition from cheaper producers in Asia and elsewhere , and the danger becomes obvious .
A second danger arises from the fact that , by liberalizing trade for only a few economically successful industries , open sectoralism weakens , rather than strengthens , the broad political support needed for the comprehensive global trade agreements that benefit most businesses , consumers , and countries .
Those talks led ultimately to the dismantling of tariff barriers in ten key sectors .
Pushed by business , the US negotiated sectoral agreements in telecoms , information technology , and financial services .
The first major deal , the Information Technology Agreement -LRB- ITA -RRB- , took effect in 1997 and covers 90 % of trade in IT products worth more than $ 600 billion annually .
The ITA was subsequently backed by the European Union after Hugo Paemen , the EU ambassador to the US , saw the ITA as proof that sectoral agreements help circumvent mounting political resistance to new trade rounds .
With the support of the two most powerful actors in world trade , the ITA model has been pursued ever since in other sectors .
A Global Agreement on Basic Telecommunications went into effect in 1998 ; a Financial Services Agreement to liberalize trade in banking , insurance , and securities was implemented in April 1999 .
Such agreements , which often dismantle not only tariffs but other regulatory barriers , may appear unassailable .
But looks deceive .
Because the powerful sectoral interests that supported liberalization during the Uruguay Round -- information technology , financial services , telecommunications -- now have their own deals , the energy they once brought to the cause of broader trade liberalization has diminished sharply .
Indeed , the Japanese believe that the halfhearted backing of US business groups for a new round of WTO talks reflects the success of the earlier sectoral agreements .
So Japan now opposes negotiating a second ITA , which it fears will further weaken political support for broad trade liberalization .
Fears for the future of comprehensive , multi-sector trade negotiations are well founded .
Continuing effort by US officials , for example , to focus narrowly on trade in services and agriculture impedes wider agreements by limiting the tradeoffs that can be made among sectors .
Moreover , a sector-by-sector approach invariably ignores a host of issues within the WTO , such as dispute settlement , anti-dumping , and the like .
The recent experience of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation -LRB- APEC -RRB- forum highlights the limitations of open sectoralism and should prompt a thorough re-appraisal .
Following the launch of the ITA , America pressed APEC 's members for accelerated liberalization on a sectoral basis as a means to revive a stalled regional trade agenda .
But efforts to reach an agreement to liberalize trade in 15 sectors soon faltered : the cost of selective liberalization in uncompetitive , but politically sensitive , sectors was simply too high for some governments to bear .
The most important lesson of APEC 's failure is a recognition of the enormous difficulty found in constructing a broad enough , and yet politically acceptable , package when trade negotiations are limited to particular beneficiaries .
Because some industries no longer care about wide trade agreements because they have already benefited through a sectoral deal , the groups that normally see themselves as gaining from greater trade openness are too weak to offset the political influence of protectionist forces mobilized against liberalization .
Policymakers who are now attracted to open sectoralism because of its delusive promise of frictionless politics should take that lesson to heart .
If the full benefits of trade liberalization are to be gained quickly , there is no alternative to resuming comprehensive negotiations -- and the tradeoffs between industries that this strategy entails -- by reviving the WTO 's Millennium Round .
It is this agenda , rather than the hollow hope of open sectoralism , that should be the main priority of trade negotiators in the future .
Make or Break for Europe 's Constitution
Make or Break for Europe 's Constitution
The challenge for the EU now is to refocus itself on the priorities of today and tomorrow .
It needs to connect better with its own citizens , to renew their support by showing that Europeans working together can foster growth and jobs , fight international crime , and secure a clean environment .
The Union needs to play a more active role in the wider world , not in pursuit of selfish interests , but in promoting the universal values on which it is founded .
Most of all , the enlarged Union needs a constitutional and institutional framework that fits its ambitions .
For thirty months , governments and parliamentarians have been working on a new constitution for Europe .
An exceptional draft was prepared by the convention chaired by former French President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing .
It is the task of national governments - of me and my colleagues in the European Council - to finish the job .
We meet in Brussels this week , and our overriding priority is to reach agreement on the constitution .
Consensus on most of the draft has existed for some time .
There is no dispute about the EU 's values and objectives , about inclusion of the Charter of Fundamental Rights , or about simplifying legislative processes .
These are all major advances .
But national governments inevitably have a particular interest in the powers of EU institutions in such key areas as foreign policy , criminal law , and taxation .
These are the issues on which final agreement now needs to be reached .
Through months of bilateral contact and negotiation among ministers , we have succeeded in whittling down the outstanding issues to a point where a fair and balanced overall package is achievable .
As in any negotiation , the key ingredients are timing and political will .
People simply were n't ready last December when a first attempt was made to finalize agreement .
The European Council 's decision in March to finish the negotiations during the Irish presidency sent a powerful signal of our determination to break the stalemate .
In the last month , I have met all of my colleagues face to face , in their capitals .
We speak often .
I detect no slackening of resolve .
In fact , there is a sense that we can not afford to fail .
In a challenging period for the Union , it needs to show that , when the chips are down , its members can make collective but difficult decisions in the common interest .
The basic institutional balances between the Commission , the Council and the European Parliament are not in question .
But the EU 's institutions need to be modernized .
Greater continuity and focus will be provided through the creation of a full-time chairman of the European Council and an EU Foreign Minister , and there is to be a three-country team presidency of other Council formations .
There is also now an acceptance that the voting system within the European Council should be based on a double majority of population and member states .
This is logical , transparent , and representative .
But the precise arrangements for double majority voting need to be calibrated in a way that respects the particular concerns of all member states , while still ensuring that the new system is more efficient than its predecessor .
I believe that we can settle this most difficult question in an equitable way .
The task of the Commission is to drive forward the EU 's agenda in the common interest .
There is a developing consensus that ` representativeness ' and legitimacy can be achieved by including nationals of all member states in the next two Commissions , with a move thereafter to a fixed smaller number based on strictly equal rotation .
There is also a need to ensure that the citizens of all member states , big and small , are adequately and appropriately represented in the European Parliament .
The constitution envisages further expanding the parliament 's important functions , both legislative and budgetary , in partnership with the member states .
In fact , for the first time , a significant watchdog role is being assigned to national parliaments .
These arrangements will preserve the EU 's unique institutional essence - the balances between its institutions and among member states - while offering the prospect of greater effectiveness , efficiency , and transparency .
The constitution will see a further major advance in the use of majority voting , which is necessary in an EU of 25 -LRB- and soon more -RRB- members .
But a few topics will have to remain subject to unanimous decision , given their special nature .
I believe we are close to a balanced agreement on this .
Too often , the complex issues involved in this kind of negotiation are presented as a battle between one country and another , or between competing ideologies .
From my own long experience of negotiation , I know that talk of winners and losers is not just unhelpful , but misleading .
Everyone must compromise , but they must also see their own hopes and concerns reflected in a final text .
If we succeed this week , it will be a triumph for the EU .
Europe is a confluence of different traditions and histories , of independent sovereign states .
But we are united in our belief that sharing sovereignty and working together is the best - indeed , the only - way forward .
Adopting a constitution means consolidating the end of the bitter divisions of the past , and a chance to build a Union that works for our 450 million people .
The Old in the New Anti-Semitism
The Old in the New Anti-Semitism
Why do so many Holocaust survivors sense emerging anti-Jewish threats before seeing them ?
Because they know how supposedly `` innocent '' insinuations grow into accusations and that accusations can become discrimination and soon after legislation . It is then that hysteria is set loose .
By doing so they strengthen our democracies in ways that no other people can .
That we have cause to listen is clear , as the results of the first round of the French presidential elections demonstrate .
But not only demagogues like Jean-Marie Le-Pen and Europe 's other lumpen extreme rightists incite trouble .
Throughout the 20
Take the case of the French Ambassador to Britain .
At a dinner party in London not long ago he described Israel as `` that shitty little country . ''
His vulgar comments are not particularly frightful .
What is worrying is the response .
He was not recalled by his government ; Tony Blair 's government did not request his recall ; popular opinion treated the matter as merely another scandal .
Indeed , the French press thought the ambassador a victim of Britain 's tabloid press , not of his contemptible sentiments .
Sadly , the French ambassador to the Court of St. James has many allies among Europe 's elites .
But Ambassador Bernard did provide a service ; he helped us to recognize how widespread this new anti-Jewishness is .
As one columnist notably said , Israel has become `` the object of hate that dare not speak its name . ''
But we must not only dare , we are obliged to speak .
We must not be silent about the daily attacks in France against Jews and synagogues .
It is a shame for all of Europe that many French Jews can not send their children to school without worrying about their security .
Anti-Semitic outrages are also reported elsewhere : in Berlin and London , in Switzerland , Italy , Sweden , the Netherlands , and in parts of Eastern Europe .
We must `` confront the new Nazi plague which is nesting in Israel , '' wrote a Syrian paper as Palestinian TV portrays Israeli soldiers as rapists and cold-blooded murderers .
The Mufti of Jerusalem stated that `` it 's not my fault that Hitler hated the Jews , they hate them just about everywhere . ''
One Friday sermon on Palestinian TV told Muslims `` to have no mercy on the Jews , no matter where you are ... kill them ... and those Americans who are like them . ''
What we must remember about anti-Semitism is that , although it always starts with Jews , it never stops with Jews .
Jew-hatred , if not contained , almost always develops into assaults on other groups and minorities and finally undermines democratic institutions and the rule of law .
So the struggle against anti-Semitism is a task for Jews and non-Jews alike .
But it is now a more diffuse struggle than ever because an astonishing element in today 's anti-Semitism is its flexibility .
Although anti-Semitism never changes its goal - to attack Jews - it does change its face , its strategy , its rationalizations , even its vocabulary .
Once Jewish religion was the target .
When Judaism did not surrender , Jews were expelled or killed .
I do not equate criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism .
It is as legitimate to oppose certain Israeli policies and decisions as it is to scrutinize any nation .
But anti-Zionism is becoming akin to anti-Semitism .
Sometimes anti-Zionists claim that they are not against Jews but are `` only '' against the Jewish state .
But suppose someone said : `` I am only against the existence of Great Britain , I am not anti-British ! ''
Or if somebody told me that `` I love Swedes , but Sweden should be abolished . ''
You would not believe them .
It is hard to love or respect a people and hate their state .
Yet people pretend that they can where Israel is concerned .
In several UN agencies , Israel-bashing is routine .
This demonization of the only democracy in the Middle East is a central part of the new anti-Jewishness .
When Israel is described `` as the enemy of all good and the repository of all that is evil , '' says Professor Irwin Cotler , a member of Canada 's parliament , it becomes a `` teaching of contempt '' within the UN .
This constant singling out of one nation as humanity 's enemy is in fact a campaign directed against the Jewish people .
Indeed , many anti-Jewish outbursts in a number of countries are rooted in condemnations of Israel that exploit anti-Semitic terminology .
Attacks on synagogues are often triggered by a defaming language about the Middle East .
Compared to previous anti-Jewish outbreaks , today 's anti-Semitism is less an attack on individual Jews than an attack on the `` collective Jew , '' the state of Israel .
Such attacks , however , have started a chain reaction of assaults across Europe and Latin America on individual Jews and Jewish institutions .
In the past the most dangerous anti-Semites were those who sought to make the world Judenrein , free of Jews .
Today the most dangerous anti-Semites are those who want to make the world Judenstaatrein , free of a Jewish state .
Can A Wimp Disarm Saddam ?
Can A Wimp Disarm Saddam ?
The UN 's weapons inspectorate chief and Iraq have agreed on tentative terms for the conduct of weapons inspections , which in theory could begin as early as two weeks from now .
But the success of any such deal depends as much on the men who will carry out the inspections as on the details of when , where , and how they are carried out .
Hans Blix will head the UN arms inspectorate charged with searching for , finding , and destroying Saddam Hussein 's weapons of mass destruction .
I have known Blix for over forty years .
In 1960 he was my deputy when I was a leader of the Swedish Liberal Youth organization .
Since then I have followed his career closely .
He became Sweden 's foreign minister for a year and was later a director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency -LRB- IAEA -RRB- in Vienna .
Personally , Blix is amiable and has a sense of humor ; politically he is weak and easily fooled .
I can think of few European officials less suitable for a showdown with Saddam Hussein .
Indeed , it is with utter disbelief that I watch television news about Blix 's negotiations with the Iraqi dictator 's henchmen .
The world has been amply warned about Blix 's weaknesses because he has a track record of compounded failure .
When Blix headed the IAEA before the Gulf War of 1991 , he blithely assured the world , after several inspections , that nothing alarming was happening in Iraq .
He delivered the clean bill of health that Saddam had hoped for when he began hiding his atomic factories and ambitions .
Since then , we have learned all too unambiguously that Saddam is obsessed with procuring weapons of mass destruction - chemical and biological warheads as well as atomic bombs and the missiles to deliver them .
Former experts of Iraq 's nuclear weapons program , who have fled Baghdad for the West , confirmed this .
They told us about determined and costly efforts to obtain doomsday devices .
Indeed , it is now clear that Saddam was but a year away from securing his first atomic bomb when the Gulf War broke out .
After that war , UN inspectors found and destroyed huge amounts of chemical and biological warheads as well as facilities to produce nuclear weapons .
Despite his grave failings as IAEA chief before 1991 , Blix once again came to lead UN disarmament inspectors , this time in tandem with another Swede , Ambassador Rolf Ekéus .
Blix , naive and relatively ignorant about technical details -- his field is international law -- is easily mislead .
Even after the Gulf war , he failed to realize that the Iraqi officials , who were again assuring the UN that they were hiding nothing , were but consummate liars .
Indeed , Blix believed that Iraq had no program at all for nuclear arms .
David Kay , perhaps the most effective arms inspector , insisted that he did not trust them .
But Blix reproached Kay for his attitude .
You must believe in official information , Blix implied .
The turning point came when Kay initiated inspections of suspect buildings without notifying the Iraqis about his intentions in advance .
This new , aggressive inspection strategy had dramatic consequences : Kay discovered material which confirmed that Iraq was only 12 to 18 months away from producing a nuclear device .
This historic discovery ended up in a confrontation at a parking lot in Baghdad .
UN cars were surrounded by 200 Iraqi soldiers and a mob , ordered out to the scene by Iraqi officials .
For four days and nights the siege continued , as Kay and his colleagues used satellite telephones to fax crucial documents to the West .
Blix had opposed the raid .
Fortunately , Ambassador Ekéus backed it and supported the inspectors during the siege .
I have met a number of experts on Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction , and they often compare the two Swedes : `` Ekéus is brilliant , '' they say , `` Blix is terrible . ''
When the current UN inspectorate was being put together in 1999 , both Ekéus and Blix were among the candidates being considered to head the new group of inspectors .
Friends of Iraq in Paris and Moscow consulted Baghdad to see whom Saddam would prefer .
France and Russia then suggested Blix .
Surprisingly the Clinton administration accepted that decision .
Saddam 's chemical and biological arms , and his determination to get nuclear weapons , are a threat to the world .
The dictator could use these arms himself or make them available to terrorist organizations .
And the issue of war and peace depends on a man repeatedly duped by the Iraqi regime .
The Bush administration probably understands Blix 's weaknesses .
My guess is that the US will not allow Blix and the inspectors that he oversees to be deceived by Iraq again .
Regardless of how this crisis develops from this point , the UN has neglected its duties by asking a wimp to lead the inspectors who are supposed to stand up to the brute of Baghdad .
The UN Heresy
The UN Heresy
No other organization is held in such respect as the United Nations .
This is perhaps natural , for the UN embodies some of humanity 's noblest dreams .
But , as the current scandal surrounding the UN 's administration of the Iraq oil for food program demonstrates , and as the world remembers the Rwanda genocide that began ten years ago , respect for the UN should be viewed as something of a superstition , with Secretary General Kofi Annan its false prophet .
Not since Dag Hammarskjöld has a UN leader been as acclaimed as Annan .
Up to a point , this is understandable .
Annan usually maintains an unruffled , dignified demeanor .
He has charm and - many say - charisma .
But a leader ought to be judged by his or her actions when important matters are at stake .
Annan 's failures in such situations are almost invariably glossed over .
Between 1993 and 1996 , Annan was Assistant Secretary-General for UN Peacekeeping Operations and then Under-Secretary-General .
One of the two great disasters for which he bears a large share of the blame is the Serbian slaughter of 7,000 people in the Bosnian town of Srebrenica , perhaps the worst massacre in postwar Europe .
In 1993 , Bosnia 's Muslems were promised that UN forces would protect them .
This commitment was a precondition of their consenting to disarm .
The UN declared Srebrenica a `` safe haven '' to be `` protected '' by 600 Dutch UN troops .
In July 1995 , Serb forces attacked . The UN did not honor its pledge .
Annan 's staff released evasive , confused statements .
Oblivious , apparently , to the dreadfulness of the situation , they failed to sound the alarm properly and did nothing to intervene .
The Dutch fired not a single shot .
NATO air power could have halted the Serbs , but Annan did not ask for NATO intervention .
Ratko Mladic , the Serb commander and war criminal , deported the women and children under the eyes of the UN , while capturing and murdering the men and adolescent boys .
No one should be surprised by the UN 's inaction , because only the year before it had demonstrated utter incompetence in facing the fastest genocide in history - the slaughter of 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus in Rwanda in just 100 days .
UN forces in Rwanda in 1994 were Annan 's responsibility before and during the crisis .
Annan was alerted four months before Hutu activists began their mass killings by a fax message from Romeo Dallaire , the Canadian general commanding UN forces in Rwanda .
Dallaire described in detail how the Hutus were planning `` anti-Tutsi extermination . ''
He identified his source `` a Hutu '' and reported that arms were ready for the impending ethnic cleansing .
Dallaire requested permission to evacuate his informant and to seize the arms cache .
Annan rejected both demands , proposing that Dallaire make the informant 's identity known to Rwandan President Habyarimana , a Hutu , even though the informant had expressly named the President 's closest entourage as the authors of the genocide blueprint .
Annan maintained his extreme passiveness even after the airplane crash that killed Habyarimana , which signaled the genocide 's start , helped by the indifference of the great powers -LRB- America not least -RRB- .
One might think Annan far too compromised for the post of Secretary-General , but the UN does n't work that way .
Instead of being forced to resign after Rwanda and Srebrenica , he was promoted to Secretary-General .
That is the culture of the UN : believe the best of barbarians , do nothing to provoke controversy among superiors , and let others be the butt of criticism afterwards .
Even subsequent revelations about Annan 's responsibility for the disasters in Rwanda and Bosnia did not affect his standing .
On the contrary , he was unanimously re-elected and awarded the Nobel Peace Prize .
He is the all-time Teflon diplomat .
The media sometimes ratchets up admiration for Annan by pointing out that his wife is Swedish and a close relative of Raoul Wallenberg .
We are meant to infer that , on top of all his talents , Annan shares the ideals embodied during the last days of WWII by the foremost Swede of modern times .
But Wallenberg 's name should make us even more dismayed about Annan 's record .
Wallenberg refused to ignore the threat of massacres to come . Instead of ducking responsibility and carrying on with conventional work in Sweden , he made his way to Hungary , the scene of Hitler 's last homicidal orgy against the Jews .
In Budapest , Wallenberg exploited every available contact , resorting to shady tricks , bribes , and other stratagems to save as many people as possible from the Holocaust .
He never allowed himself to be duped by Hitler 's cronies .
Perhaps no one 's achievement should be judged by comparison with that of Wallenberg - a titan of strength , courage , and perseverance .
The trouble with Annan is that , when similar perils loomed , he proved especially wanting .
Annan can not plead that he faced any risk to his personal safety , whereas Wallenberg in 1944 and 1945 was in constant peril .
Nor can he possibly excuse himself by saying that no warnings were given , or that he lacked resources , or that he did not have the international position to intervene .
Annan had at his disposal all of the instruments of power and opinion that Wallenberg lacked .
Yet when thousands or hundreds of thousands of people were exposed to mortal threats that he had the authority and duty to avert , alleviate , or at least announce , he failed abjectly .
Now , despite the recent revelations about briberies in the UN 's oil-for-food program for Iraq , the world is clamoring to entrust Annan with the future of more than 20 million Iraqis who survived Saddam Hussein 's depraved dictatorship .
That is both because of who Annan is and what the UN has become : an institution in which no shortcoming , it seems , goes unrewarded .
Europe and Asia 's Arms Race
Europe and Asia 's Arms Race
When European unification was launched , it was thought that `` ever closer union '' would establish a community that would protect Europeans from political blackmail .
Now we see -- though the lifting of the Union 's arms embargo may now be delayed thanks to US pressure and Chinese aggressiveness -- that the European Union has become merely a tool for corruption when France and China draw up joint action plans .
The strategy is simple and ruthless . The world 's largest dictatorship is preparing to crush and occupy the first Chinese democracy in history -- Taiwan .
In order to do so , the People 's Republic needs much more sophisticated arms than those it possesses today .
The United States naturally does not export such arms to China . Instead , the US is trying to deter China 's rulers from launching a military attack on the democrats in Taiwan .
But if the EU ever begins to offer China extensive exports of powerful and offensive weapons systems , the military power of the People 's Liberation Army would be able to defeat Taiwan 's defense forces .
Over 600 missiles , already deployed on the mainland , are aimed at cities and military bases on the island .
The threat is more apparent than real -- for now .
Russia currently sells certain arms to China , but avoids exporting its most sophisticated systems , since the Kremlin views China as a potential future threat .
However , if EU countries start competing for a share of the Chinese market , the Russians could soon be tempted to sell their best arms to the communist regime in Beijing .
China 's new armaments , together with the North Korean crisis , will probably force half a dozen countries in the region to renew their armed forces .
Thus , by whenever the Union should decide to lift its ban on weapons exports to China , the EU could help fuel an arms race in East Asia .
How did China and France manage to fool the EU into thinking that it should ever take part in this ?
When Jacques Chirac 's government decided to expound its economic co-operation with China , arms became an important component in the strategy .
Just as a ruthless Prime Minister Chirac sold a nuclear reactor to Saddam Hussein in the 1970 's , so the President Chirac of today is being lured into doing big business with another aggressive dictatorship .
The rest is a question of economic blackmail .
French diplomats have of course informed China about the reluctance of other European countries about lifting the arms embargo , which was imposed after the massacre in Tiananmen Square in 1989 .
China then simply threatened to abandon or never to conclude trade deals with these EU members .
China follows the power game within the EU through its French friends , and therefore knows which governments need to be whipped into line .
In Sweden , it has probably been enough to whisper `` Ericsson '' and `` Volvo '' to make Primer Minister Göran Persson understand what is at stake for his country commercially .
What European nation , indeed , dares to put at risk a Chinese order for several billion euros ?
Typically enough , no EU-country has mentioned Taiwan as a reason not to resume arms exports .
Instead , the EU talks of a `` code of conduct '' -LRB- which probably does not mean very much , but sounds nice -RRB- and `` free trade '' -LRB- another charming euphemism for arms exports to dictatorships .
This silence gives a hideous signal .
For what the EU in practice says to China is this : `` Taiwan 's cause in not our own . ''
As usual , it is up to America to protect a free nation that may otherwise be destroyed .
Compare this situation to the drama 60 years ago . Then it was American troops and arms that liberated Western Europe from Nazism .
Now it may be European arms in the hands of the Chinese that will be aimed at American troops protecting a democracy with 23 million inhabitants -LRB- in other words , as many people as in all the Nordic countries combined -RRB- .
Lantos knows about moral compasses : as a boy , he was rescued by Raoul Wallenberg from being deported to Auschwitz by the Nazis in Budapest .
But now Sweden is revealing that it , too , lacks political morality .
Over the past ten years , we have held Scandinavian conferences on Taiwan in the parliaments in Copenhagen , Oslo , and Stockholm .
But a call from Prime Minister Persson was enough to render the Conservative party leader Fredrik Reinfeldt docile .
Reinfeldt became the first Conservative party leader in Swedish history to encourage arms exports to a Communist dictatorship .
But Reinfeldt , like Jacques Chirac , has forgotten something . Liberal-minded people may very well prefer not just to exchange one cynical prime minister for another at the next election .
They may prefer a clear choice .
China Must Do More than Mediate
China Must Do More than Mediate
Despair is dangerous in diplomacy . But North Korea 's latest actions are making much of Asia hopeless .
Only China , long reluctant to flex its diplomatic muscles , now has the power to find a diplomatic solution to the North Korean nuclear problem .
But the question everyone from Tokyo to Seoul and from Washington to Moscow is asking is this : will China act in time ?
China 's influence on North Korea is uniquely powerful .
China is keeping its increasingly desperate neighbor on life support by providing most of the non-food aid and energy that North Korea receives from abroad .
But to prevent North Korea from realizing a fait accompli in its pursuit of nuclear weapons , China must do more than mediate between North Korea and the US , the role it has so far played .
Instead , it must now prompt North Korea to halt its nuclear development activities and return to the six-party talks with America , Japan , China , Russia , and South Korea that broke up weeks ago .
Recent developments indicate that North Korea 's nuclear threat is becoming more serious by the day .
Two weeks ago , North Korea declared that in June it successfully reprocessed some 8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods and now possesses `` nuclear deterrence , '' suggesting that Kim Jong Il 's regime may actually be making atomic bombs .
Not only does North Korea show little interest in holding another session of the six-party talks that the Bush administration and the other participants are calling for ; it now wants to ban the Japanese from participating .
Kim accuses Japan of introducing unnecessary obstacles and complications into resolution of the nuclear question by raising the sensitive issue of North Korea 's abduction of Japanese citizens .
But this is nothing more than a political diversion .
It is inconceivable that multilateral negotiations could result in a breakthrough toward a diplomatic solution while North Korea is actively engaged in pursuing its nuclear weapons program .
It must be clear by now that Pyongyang is determined to keep its nuclear weapons program in order to obtain a credible assurance from the US that its bizarre and repressive regime will be allowed to survive .
Unless America accommodates North Korea 's demands for concluding a nonaggression treaty and ending `` hostile '' policies , Kim 's regime is likely to keep its nuclear weapons program as its most effective deterrent against any preemptive US attack -- something that the Bush administration , indeed , refuses to rule out .
America 's military victory in the war in Iraq probably hardened North Korea 's resolve to rely on the nuclear option as its primary means of ensuring regime survival .
But that should not surprise anyone : the North Korean regime has always been committed to making military power the `` first priority '' in the state budget .
This contrasts sharply with policies pursued by China and Vietnam , Asia 's two other communist powers .
In both countries , the leadership places military power last in their national development strategies .
It would be difficult for the US to change the highest priority of its own national security strategy -- preempting terrorism and fighting the spread of weapons of mass destruction -- especially with another nuclear threat looming in Iran .
Insofar as the goal of preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula is concerned , the US has thus succeeded by sustaining an ad hoc concert of powers thus far with China , Japan , Russia , and South Korea .
Indeed , in their first-ever joint declaration , Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao , Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi , and South Korean President Roh Moo Hyun issued a plea on the sidelines of the ASEAN summit held in Bali on October 8 for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula .
All sides realize that failure to achieve this would most likely result in a nuclear chain reaction with Japan , South Korea , and perhaps even Taiwan embarking on their own nuclear weapons development programs .
That scenario is China 's worst nightmare .
So the question now is what can China do to freeze -- and , if possible , to reverse -- North Korea 's nuclear program .
China finds itself in a delicate position , pulled in one direction by its desire to avoid a precipitous North Korean collapse , and in the opposite direction by its overriding need to deepen economic relations with the US , Japan , and South Korea .
This is why at the UN Security Council China opposed any military action or sanctions against North Korea , a country for which it sacrificed almost one million troops during the Korean War in 1950-53 .
It is in China 's vital national interest to halt North Korea 's quest to become another declared nuclear power .
China 's success here would not only enhance its own international prestige , but would also contribute immensely to promoting regional stability and prosperity throughout East Asia .
America 's Retreat from Asia
America 's Retreat from Asia
The United States ' planned withdrawal of troops from Asia , which President George W. Bush announced on August 16 , need not harm peace and stability in the region and particularly in Korea .
But a key condition for a smooth redeployment of US troops is close consultations by America with its allies , something it has not done well up to now .
South Korea and Japan need to have their views taken into serious account if this now inevitable withdrawal is to succeed .
By contrast , unilaterally announcing the withdrawal - and then unilaterally implementing it - may harm the very purpose that the remaining US troops in Asia are intended to serve : assuring deterrence , stability , and nonproliferation in Korea and Asia .
The withdrawal plan is causing countless worries .
In Japan , there are concerns that it will make the country America 's frontline command post in Asia , possibly beyond the scope of its bilateral security treaty with the US .
One result is that China feels nervous about the implications of any expansion of the American-Japanese military partnership .
But the impact of America 's planned troop withdrawals is felt most keenly in South Korea .
In June , the Bush administration revealed its plan to withdraw some 12,500 of the 37,000 US soldiers stationed in South Korea by the end of 2005 .
These include 3,600 troops from the 2nd Brigade of the 2nd Infantry Division , who are already earmarked for redeployment in Iraq .
The US Defense Department justifies this change as part of the so-called `` Global Posture Review '' that it has been carrying out to provide more flexibility and mobility in deploying troops to more urgently needed places around the world .
But the unilateral nature of the announcement , and the abrupt timing of the plan , has incited alarm in South Korea , and perhaps in Japan , that withdrawal could pose serious risks to the vital role that US forces have performed in deterring another war in Korea .
South Koreans genuinely fear that the plan may weaken deterrence by sending North Korea - which is demanding a US military withdrawal while refusing to abandon its nuclear weapons ambitions - the message that intransigence pays .
Indeed , it should not be forgotten that North Korea maintains an army of 1.1 million troops .
Moreover , the manner in which the Bush administration unveiled its withdrawal plan has weakened the credibility of the US-Korean alliance .
America 's unilateral announcement has fuelled rumors to the effect that withdrawal must have something to do with the rising tide of anti-Americanism in South Korea , and especially with the country 's reluctance and delay in dispatching an additional 3,600 of its own soldiers to Iraq .
The Bush administration tries to rebut these charges by saying that the plan will not weaken the deterrence capabilities of American forces , for America 's far more powerful air and naval presence in the area will be maintained .
Moreover , the US plans to strengthen South Korea 's own forces by supplying some $ 11 billion worth of high-technology equipment over the next five years .
Militarily , this argument does make sense .
Politically and psychologically , however , the method , let alone the timing and implementation of the withdrawals , raises many questions about the ongoing viability of the US-Korean security alliance , for the alliance now seems adrift , without a common purpose and with little direction from either side .
Yet the Bush administration insists : `` The US views South Korea as a strong and steadfast ally .
We are committed to South Korea 's security and to our alliance and partnership with Seoul . ''
If Washington is serious about these words , it should transform this commitment into a long-term and comprehensive alliance that can survive the current estrangement - and continue even after Korean unification - by making a joint declaration with South Korea 's government at the highest level .
In order to allay misgivings and restore trust in the alliance , it is necessary for the US and South Korea to reaffirm their common interests and values in pursuing deterrence , nonproliferation , stability , and democracy on the Korean peninsula and across Asia .
Once they resolve to continue their alliance with these purposes in mind , it should be possible for responsible officials to work out guiding principles for concrete security cooperation .
Specific negotiations on withdrawing American troops from Korea or on redeploying them from the DMZ to south of Seoul must be carried out according to these principles .
In so doing , America must treat South Korea as a full partner with its own voice in making decisions that affect its security interests .
As an American ally for 51 years , and as East Asia 's third-largest economy , South Korea is entitled to be fully consulted on such decisions .
Despite anti-American sentiments among some South Koreans , a majority of the country 's people wants American forces to remain as a stabilizing force .
Securing a peaceful and nuclear-free Korean peninsula , a place where the interests of China , Japan , Russia , and America directly intersect , is one of the most important security goals anywhere on the planet .
For this reason , America and South Korea must restore a strategic vision for the future .
The EU Must Start Negotiations with Turkey
On December 17 of last year , the European Council decided to open accession negotiations with Turkey this October .
Two conditions were put to the Turkish government : a comprehensive legal reform aimed at reinforcing the rule of law and human rights , and approval of the Adaptation Protocol of the Ankara Agreement , which extends the customs union with the EU to all new member states , including the Republic of Cyprus .
Turkey has met these conditions : the legal reform entered into force on June 1 , and the Protocol was signed on July 29 .
A formal recognition by Turkey of the Republic of Cyprus , including its extension to the Northern part of the island , was not requested as a precondition for starting accession talks .
This is a complex matter related to the efforts by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan to negotiate a comprehensive settlement leading to reunification of the island .
Last year , both Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot community accepted the Secretary General 's proposals , which were , however , rejected by the Greek Cypriot side .
There is every reason to expect Annan to resume his good offices soon and to bring the question to a positive conclusion well before Turkey 's possible entry into the EU around 2015 .
The Cyprus issue should therefore not be construed as an obstacle to the start of negotiations .
The same is true of the reported intention of some EU governments to have the so-called `` Privileged Partnership '' concept explicitly included in the negotiating framework as an alternative to full membership .
This proposal was discussed at last December 's European Council meeting and rejected , resulting in a reference to `` open-ended negotiations '' in the Council 's conclusions . That wording -- never used in previous enlargement rounds -- may have ruffled Turkey 's feathers , but it was finally accepted as the type of constructive ambiguity that is so often used in international diplomacy .
It is nonetheless obvious from the very nature of accession negotiations that full membership must be the goal .
Without that prospect , no candidate country would go through the painful process of adopting the tens of thousands of rules and regulations contained in the Acquis Communautaire -LRB- the body of EU law -RRB- .
To ensure that it does , is , after all , the main purpose of accession talks .
Moreover , it is difficult to imagine what advantages could be offered to Turkey in the framework of a `` Privileged Partnership '' beyond its long-time status as an Associate Member of the EU .
The Customs Union concluded ten years ago allows free trade for all but agricultural goods .
Turkey is invited to Council meetings , it can participate in various EU programs and in manifestations of the European Common Foreign Policy , and , as a member of NATO , it is a partner in EU-NATO security cooperation .
Finally , like all candidate countries , Turkey also receives financial and technical assistance in support of ongoing reform programs .
Short of full membership , there is hardly room for added value in Turkey 's relationship with the EU .
Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn has spelt it out with the necessary clarity : `` If we stick to what we have ourselves decided at the highest political level in the European Council , as we should , I am reasonably confident that the negotiations shall start on the October 3 . ''
This statement is to the credit of the European Commission , and there is not much to be added , except to emphasize that it is up to EU governments to treat Turkey with the fairness that all candidate countries deserve .
To renege on formal decisions and commitments , or to add last-minute obstacles , would make a mockery of the Union 's credibility .
Negotiations therefore must begin on October 3 .
TB and HIV : A Combination Made in Hell We have interviewed many people living with TB in Tanzania and Nigeria , and Fatima 's fears and concerns are not unique .
People with TB are commonly stigmatized in sub-Saharan Africa . Lack of accurate information about the disease is widespread .
These realities prevent people who believe they are infected with TB from seeking treatment .
In many regions -- and especially in rural areas -- people still believe that TB patients have been bewitched , poisoned , or , as one Nigerian doctor put it , `` cursed by the gods . ''
More than half a million Africans and two million people globally die each year from TB , the leading infectious cause of death for people with HIV\/AIDS .
To make matters worse , HIV\/AIDS is fueling a dramatic resurgence of TB .
In Tanzania , for example , the number of TB cases increased almost six-fold between 1983 and 2003 , from approximately 12,000 to 64,500 .
HIV\/AIDS has resulted in a 6 % annual increase in the prevalence of TB in Nigeria , which now has the highest number of new TB cases in Africa .
Yet TB is commonly considered a disease of the past .
Most people -- even those at greatest risk of contracting the disease , including people living with HIV\/AIDS -- lack accurate information about TB 's symptoms or where to seek treatment .
Despite the fact that in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa more than half of all TB patients are HIV-positive , most HIV\/AIDS testing sites do not offer TB diagnostic and treatment services .
Those sites that do offer such testing find it much more difficult to diagnose TB among patients infected with both diseases , because current diagnostic tests fail to detect active TB in 60-80 % of people with HIV\/AIDS .
Political leaders across the globe have made a series of public commitments to address the deadly double impact of TB and HIV\/AIDS .
One year ago , in Maputo , Mozambique , for example , African health ministers declared TB a `` regional emergency '' and lined up behind a new `` Global Plan to Stop TB , '' which includes specific targets and guidelines for addressing TB\/HIV co-infection .
Some positive steps have been taken .
Tanzania has experimented with community-based programs that send health workers to the homes of TB patients in order to monitor treatment compliance and provide support .
Yet these efforts have not been taken on a large scale and are not sufficient to stem the dramatic resurgence of TB caused by HIV\/AIDS .
The political will to implement the commitments that governments have undertaken is still lacking .
For Fatima and thousands of people like her , government declarations will become meaningful only when they are translated into better services .
This means rapid expansion of TB centers , so that patients do n't have to choose between treatment and caring for their families .
It also means careful coordination of TB and HIV programs , so that people living with both diseases can receive treatment in the same location .
Finally , significant assistance and investment in research and development from wealthy countries is needed , so that free TB treatment is truly available and accessible to all .
The resurgence of TB has become a grave health emergency , and the world can no longer afford to be lethargic in addressing it .
As Stephen Lewis , the UN Secretary General 's Special Envoy on HIV\/AIDS in Africa , has stated , `` TB and HIV act on each other with fatal force -- a combination made in hell . ''
HIV\/AIDS activists and policymakers need to focus much greater attention on TB .
Fatima and those like her deserve nothing less .
Turkey Plays the European Card
Turkey Plays the European Card
Elected with a parliamentary majority almost big enough to change the country 's constitution , Turkey 's new Islamist government faces daunting challenges .
The most urgent is the looming war between America and Iraq .
Will Turkey maintain its vital diplomatic and logistical support for its American ally ?
Or will religious solidarities reshape Turkey 's orientation , as the new government joins other Muslim countries in opposing any invasion of Iraq ?
Obviously , Turkey 's Islamists are not the only ones with serious doubts about the war .
Many Turks share the view that the war could have harsh consequences for their country , both in the short and long run .
The struggling economy does not need the disruption of even a rapidly resolved military conflict .
The Turkish establishment -LRB- the military as well as the diplomatic corps -RRB- worries about the possibility that a war will fracture Iraq , leading to an independent Kurdish state on Turkey 's southern border that would inevitably serve to strengthen Kurdish nationalism within Turkey , raising new threats to Turkey 's unity and stability .
Turkey 's secular bureaucratic establishment has traditionally been pro-West but with a strong dose of nationalism .
Aside from the Kurdish issue , their attention is now focused on Cyprus as well .
The Cyprus problem has reached a critical turning point , following a peace proposal put on the table by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan with a deadline impending at the end of February .
Meanwhile , the Greek Cypriots have been given their entry invitation to the EU , despite the fact that there is still no agreement on the Cyprus problem .
Cyprus now becomes a key issue athwart the road of Turkey eventually joining the EU .
Unresolved , it will provide a sure means of preventing Turkey 's membership by those who are against it .
This constitutes another potential trap for the new government .
Despite the importance of Cyprus , it is the possible war with Iraq that poses the most severe test of the delicate balance that now exists between Turkey 's conservative old guard and the more liberal reformers within the ruling Justice and Development Party .
Could it lead to a new power struggle in the party ?
The fact that the party leader Mr. Erdogan was prevented through technicalities from becoming a deputy in the Parliament and thus Prime Minister makes the maintenance of this balance even more tricky .
Any open rupture will weaken the hands of the reformers who want to have close ties with the West and the US .
Though the Justice and Development Party has held power only briefly , it has already given clear indications of its choice .
Well aware of western doubts about the party , Erdogan traveled immediately after the elections to western capitals , pressing his argument that the change in government had not changed Turkey 's fundamental orientation .
He is well aware of the contrast with the approach taken by Turkey 's previous Islamist-led government .
Elected in 1996 , after a campaign marked by strong claims of religious revival , the Welfare Party 's Necmettin Erbakan made a conspicuous point of making his first official visits to Iran , Libya , Indonesia and Malaysia .
Erdogan stressed this pro-Western orientation again but a few weeks later , at the EU enlargement summit held in Copenhagen in mid-December .
The new government 's aggressive lobbying before the summit was perceived both at home and abroad as a clear sign of its commitment to the EU cause .
Rejecting Erbakan 's earlier accusation that the EU was a `` Christian Club , '' Erdogan has campaigned openly for full membership .
In this , he received enthusiastic support from the Bush administration , which hopes that Erdogan might have found a way to mix democracy and Islam .
So far , Erdogan has played the European card skillfully , reassuring Turkey 's western allies and boxing in the Turkish military , which remains skeptical of his party 's intentions .
By accepting European demands for democratic reform as a pre-condition for EU membership , Erdogan played a liberalizing role , reinforcing his claim that his party represents a genuinely democratic option for a Muslim-majority country B indeed , that it is an Islamic version of the Christian Democratic parties that have long dominated Europe 's political right .
There is no doubt that the political and economic program of Erdogan and his party is a dramatic departure from traditional Turkish Islamism .
Islamist movements have generally been characterized by strong anti-market and anti-western attitudes .
Yet Prime Minister Gul routinely calls his government `` business friendly . ''
The coming months will be crucial .
To convince skeptics , the party will have to break with conventional Turkish policies on Cyprus , and with conventional Islamist doubts about Europe .
To top it off , Turkey must reach some agreement with its closest ally , the US , if it moves against Iraq .
Erdogan 's insistent opening to Europe may be the key to how this all turns out .
By pressing for membership in the EU , he is reinforcing Turkey 's long-held western orientation .
This may give him room to distance himself somewhat from American policy .
After all , in becoming more European , is n't Turkey entitled to share Europe 's doubts about a war with Iraq ?
India 's Agony MUMBAI -- In most cities of South Asia , hidden beneath the grime and neglect of extreme poverty , there exists a little Somalia waiting to burst out and infect the body politic .
This netherworld , patrolled and nourished by criminals who operate a vast black-market economy , has bred , in Mumbai , a community that has utter contempt for the state , because it knows that its survival depends on corrupting the police . Like underground magma , that underworld has now burst into the streets of Mumbai .
Because the denizens of this netherworld know neither patriotism nor morality , they are easily lured into partnership with terrorists , particularly when they have reason to feel aggrieved .
In Mumbai , a large proportion of them are Muslims who were denied space in the formal economy and have developed strong vested interests over the past 50 years .
Details about the Mumbai outrage , where terrorists killed over 100 people , are still unfolding .
But we do know that at least 30 men armed with AK47 rifles and grenades held India 's business and financial center hostage , targeting both Indians and foreigners , particularly Americans and British .
It is likely that this operation was propelled from Pakistan through the Lashkar e Tauba , a terrorist organization sustained by hatred of secular India and backed by shadowy Pakistani agencies and street support .
The attacks were an operation that must have required months of planning : serious weapons were deployed , a small army was mobilized , targets were studied , transport was organized , and weak points identified .
A plan of attack that involved hundreds of people was put in motion , and yet the massive infrastructure of India 's government discovered nothing .
The chief of India 's Anti-Terrorist Squad , Hemant Karkare -LRB- who lost his life in the battles that raged through the night -RRB- received a death threat from the nearby city of Pune , but his own unit did not bother to investigate it , since it was busy playing games on behalf of its political masters .
Complacency and politics gave the terrorists more protection than silence or camouflage ever could .
Indeed , the attacks represent more than a failure of police work . They represent a collapse of governance ; these are the wages of the sins of administrative incompetence and political malfeasance .
India is a tough nation . No one should have illusions about that .
It has fought off Muslim terrorists in Kashmir , Sikh terrorists in Punjab , Christian terrorists in Nagaland , and Hindu terrorists in Assam and across the country . It understands that you can not blame the whole community for the sins of a few .
But under ineffectual governance , particularly during the last three years , India is in danger of degenerating into a soft state .
Instead of being an international leader in the worldwide war against terrorism , it is sinking into the despair of a perpetual victim .
Indeed , India stands only behind Iraq in the number of people killed each year in terrorist attacks .
Three years ago , Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh rather smugly told President George W. Bush in Delhi that Indian Muslims were not involved in any act of terrorism .
The implication was that the integration of Muslims in Indian society constituted a success story . Muslims , Singh implied , also benefit from the virtues of democracy , a conclusion that Bush happily repeated .
But Singh certainly did not fool any of the terrorists , some of whom may have read his self-congratulation as a challenge for them to act .
I am an Indian and a Muslim and proud to be both .
Like any Indian , today I am angry , frustrated , and depressed .
I am angry at the manic dogs of war who have invaded Mumbai .
I am frustrated by the impotence of my government in Mumbai and Delhi , tone-deaf to the anguish of my fellow citizens .
And I am depressed at the damage being done to the idea of India .
BERKELEY and DURHAM -- A great strength of economics is its ability to examine how decisions are made from the point of view of decision makers .
For example , economics can explain in this way why consumers buy what they do .
It also offers a perspective on why employees work for some employers and not others , why they work as hard as they do , and , indeed , why they go to work at all .
But in most economic analysis , the decision makers ' point of view is quite narrow .
It starts with what people like and do n't like .
People may have a taste for oranges or bananas , or a preference for enjoying life today instead of saving for the future .
They then decide what to buy or how much to save , given prevailing prices , interest rates , and their own income .
Economists have included in such analysis that people interact with others , but they have largely treated such social interactions in a mechanical fashion , as if they were commodities .
For example , in the standard economic analysis of workplace gender discrimination , men do not like to associate with women on the job -- in the same way that they might prefer apples to oranges .
Likewise , the standard economic analysis of racial discrimination is that whites do not want to associate with non-whites , and so demand a premium to buy from or work with non-whites .
But neither gender nor racial discrimination arises from purely personal preferences .
People take such codes seriously .
For example , in the case of gender , those who identify as men also want to behave as men are supposed to behave ; those who identify as women want to behave as women are supposed to behave .
When we examine people 's decisions from the perspective of their identities and social norms , we get new answers to many different economic questions .
Who people are and how they think of themselves is key to the decisions that they make .
Their identities and norms are basic motivations .
We call this approach identity economics .
To grasp the relevance of identity economics , and how it differs from standard economics , consider an otherwise puzzling fact .
Men and women in the United States smoked cigarettes at vastly different rates at the beginning of the twentieth century , but these rates largely converged by the 1980 's .
Women now smoke just as much as men .
We can not explain this convergence in terms of standard economic arguments , such as changes in relative prices and incomes , because no such changes were sufficiently large .
But we can explain it if we ask how people think about themselves -- that is , if we examine changes in gender norms .
Women early in the twentieth century were not supposed to smoke ; it was inappropriate behavior .
By the 1970 's , however , advertising campaigns targeted `` liberated '' women , telling them that smoking was not only acceptable , but desirable .
This example is just the tip of the iceberg .
Taking social norms seriously has consequences that pervade the economic system , and also our lives more generally .
Overall military pay is relatively flat -- that is , it does not go up and down depending on performance , and it is also lower than for comparable positions in civilian firms .
Nothing in standard economic analysis can make sense of such a pay structure -- or of the rituals that are central to military tradition .
But with identity economics it all makes sense , and we gain an entirely new perspective on work incentives , not just in the military , but in all pursuits .
In organizations that function well , employees identify with their work and their organizations .
If employees feel more like insiders -- a key purpose of military rituals -- there is little need for incentive pay or pay-for-performance schemes .
The military changes the identity of its recruits , inculcating in them values such as duty and service .
In the civilian world , too , the most important determinant of whether an organization functions well is not the monetary incentive system , as standard economic models would imply , but whether its workers identify with the organization and with their job within it .
If they do not , they will seek to game the incentive system , rather than to meet the organization 's goals .
Likewise , good schooling occurs not as a result of monetary rewards and costs -- the stock-in-trade of conventional economics -- but because students , parents , and teachers identify with their schools , and because that identification is associated with learning .
Moreover , whether students identify with being in school becomes the major determinant of whether they stay or drop out .
Given this , education policy should look at what some successful programs have done to establish a school identity that motivates students and teachers to work according to a common purpose .
If we focus on training teachers in how to inspire their students to identify with their school -- rather than teaching students to take standardized tests -- we just might be able to reproduce these schools ' great results .
As economists and policymakers , we could be content to continue looking only at prices and income and related statistics to explain people 's decisions .
In some circumstances , that might be enough to understand what is happening .
But in many other situations , we would miss major sources of motivation -- and thus would adopt useless , if not counter-productive , measures aimed at producing the outcomes we seek .
Identity Economics provides the broader , better vision that we need .
Putin 's Ark
Putin 's Ark
Recently I visited Moscow after five years away .
The city , which looked different and strange , impressed me by its ability to change .
My days back in Russia were divided between official meetings , hours wasted in traffic jams , and nights spent with old friends who tried to show me the best of Moscow nightlife .
On my first free evening , I was invited to a place called `` Shinok . ''
The restaurant had many of the traits found in ethnic restaurants everywhere .
Different bits of kitsch , this time Ukrainian , were richly represented .
But the interior decoration had one unique element -- an artificial wall with windows separating a part of the restaurant hall .
Behind the wall was a stage set of a village yard .
A real cow , as well as chickens and geese populated that ersatz farmyard .
At times an old woman in traditional dress appeared to feed the animals .
Visitors enjoying borscht and pirogi observed her efforts with satisfaction .
`` She works for the restaurant , '' my acquaintance explained .
`` She feeds animals and sits in the yard to create the rustic ambiance . ''
Shinok was just an introduction to today 's new wave of Moscow restaurant culture .
A few days later , I visited `` The White Sun of the Desert , '' another ethnic hangout .
The White Sun existed in Soviet times .
Back then , it was called `` Uzbekistan '' and was nothing more than an obligatory culinary demonstration of the supposedly unbreakable union of the USSR 's fifteen fraternal republics .
Although the restaurant interior had completely changed since then , its decorative themes remained the same .
Nowadays , however , the establishment is named after a popular Soviet borscht-western -LRB- or `` eastern '' -RRB- filmed in 1969 and set in Central Asia during the 1919 Civil War .
The restaurant is decorated not only with oriental carpets , but with life-size figures of the movie 's heroes firing machine guns or sitting on crates of dynamite .
This Soviet `` orientalism '' is reinforced by pretty waitresses dressed in sexy outfits more inspired by the Arabian Nights than by any Central Asian reality -- then or now .
But the Soviet past , not ethnic motifs , are the biggest element in contemporary Muscovite restaurant design .
The club-restaurant `` Major Pronin : '' is conveniently located in the vicinity of the KGB-FSB headquarters .
It is named after the hero of bad Soviet-era spy novels , a figure who was also the butt of many underground jokes .
The restaurant 's interior is decorated with various pieces of espionage equipment .
But the main attraction is a shooting gallery where patrons can test their skills between courses .
Targets depicting serial killers and drug dealers have mottos like `` Save a woman '' or `` Save a boy '' on them .
In the middle of the wall is a target representing New York 's World Trade Center being approached by an aircraft , with the inscription `` Save America . ''
A new club called `` Zone '' -- Russian slang for a concentration camp -- is designed to reproduce the feeling of gulag life .
Barking Alsatian dogs , stern guards , and waiters dressed in inmate uniforms work hard to recreate the gulag 's sinister atmosphere .
Russian literature is not forgotten .
A `` rumka '' is a vodka glass from which exhausted proletarians could revive themselves .
Of course `` rumochnaia '' had nothing in common with Nikolai Gogol , but the establishment named after the famous writer does have a skating rink that is used once a day by a man dressed up as Gogol .
After my return to Washington , I had a dinner with an American politician who had just visited Saint Petersburg .
As a special honor , his Russian hosts organized an excursion to Strelna , the `` Russian Versailles , '' which was recently restored from ruin to become the Petersburg residence of President Vladimir Putin .
The palace did n't impress the American .
The amount of marble used for renovation seemed excessive , and the understanding of what constitutes luxury appeared to correspond to the standards of a Holiday Inn .
The American 's excited Russian hosts asked him constantly for his opinion of the palace .
Throughout the tour , the American answered with polite exclamations like `` exquisite '' or `` striking . ''
Finally , they reached the attic .
At last , the American was excited .
The attic of the presidential residence was designed as a belly of the seventeenth-century ship .
`` The last time I saw something like this was in a Hamburg beer hall in the 1960 's , '' the politician told me .
How perfect , I thought , as I imagined Russia 's president climbing the stairs to the attic of his palace to play the role of Peter the Great .
Like the customers in that Ukrainian-style village restaurant , perhaps Putin found his attic ark reassuring in some unconscious way .
A historical wave beyond his control had lifted the former KGB lieutenant colonel from out of the shadows to the pinnacle of power .
But fate might also just as suddenly wash him away .
What could be better than to have an ark at hand if one day the political tides turn ?

Rushdie a la Russe
Rushdie a la Russe
June will be a cruel month in Russia 's courts .
On June 16th , the rebellious oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky and his comrade-in-arms Platon Lebedev finally began to face the judges of the Meshchansky district court .
No doubt , this case will attract the Russian and international press .
Hearings began just the day before Khodorkovsky 's trial opened in another case that is no less significant .
But this case is not about oligarchs trying to interfere in politics ; it is about a group of artists and curators whose professional activities have unexpectedly turned into a political hot potato .
In January 2003 , a gang of Russian Orthodox activists destroyed an exhibition in the Sakharov Museum and Public Center called `` Caution !
Religion . ''
The organizers of the exhibition stated that they wanted to attract attention to the new role of religious institutions in Russian life .
But the Orthodox fundamentalists found the art blasphemous and offensive , and some trashed the exhibition .
Last December , prosecutors charged two Sakharov Museum officials and three of the exhibition 's organizers with inciting religious hatred .
The vandals , meanwhile , were hailed by church officials as heroes .
All charges against them were dismissed .
The vandals had influential protectors .
All of them were members of the congregation of St. Nicholas in Pyzhi , whose archpriest , Alexander Shargunov , is a well-known radical fundamentalist .
In 1997 , he established a movement called the Social Committee For the Moral Revival of the Fatherland .
In 2001 , the committee 's Web site carried instructions on how to vandalize `` immoral '' billboards by splashing paint on them .
Followers promptly destroyed 150 billboards in Moscow .
A group of well-known nationalist intellectuals , including film director Nikita Mikhalkov , artist Ilya Glazunov , and writers Valentin Rasputin and Vasily Belov , weighed in with a petition calling the exhibition a `` new stage of conscious Satanism . ''
They wrote that Russia 's enemies were bent on humiliating the powerless `` Russian people , their objects of worship , and their historic values . ''
Who , precisely , were these powerful enemies ?
The intellectuals did n't identify them , but the fascist political party Pamyat -LRB- Memory -RRB- did not hesitate .
The appeal posted on its Web site called on Orthodox Christians to protect `` our Lord Jesus Christ '' from `` Yid-degenerates , '' using the most derogatory Russian term for Jews .
These alarming events in the art world have taken place against a background of rising nationalism and Orthodox assertiveness in Russia .
The Orthodox Church has acquired enormous political clout in recent years , and few politicians risk offending it .
The Sakharov Museum exhibition was subjected to a vituperative media campaign , and the matter was almost immediately taken up in the Duma , where nationalist deputies vied with each other to denounce the artists and laud the vandals .
In February 2003 , the Duma passed a decree stating that the Sakharov museum exhibition 's purpose was to incite religious hatred and to insult believers and the Orthodox Church .
The state prosecutor was ordered to take action against the organizers , with 265 of 267 deputies approving the measure .
In April 2003 , the Duma voted to toughen the law against inciting religious hatred by adding prison terms of up to five years for offenders .
In December 2003 , Sakharov Museum director Yuri Samodurov was charged with actions `` leading to the provocation of hatred and enmity . ''
If found guilty , he could be sentenced to up to five years in prison .
Church officials are not calling for that harsh a penalty .
In March 2004 , the Moscow Patriarchy 's External Relations Department issued a statement that surprised everyone .
It asserted , in effect , that the Sakharov Museum exhibition organizers had committed an administrative rather than a criminal offense .
The difference is that administrative offenses are punished with fines , at most , not prison terms .
Such a softening of the church 's position was probably the result of the public outcry in Russia 's liberal press .
Yet the pogrom at the Sakharov museum provoked a chain reaction of similar attacks on contemporary art by Orthodox fundamentalists whom the church has been unable to control .
Anna Alchuk , an artist who participated in the exhibition in the Sakaharov Center and was later charged , said she had read all 14 volumes of evidence collected by the prosecutor , and that 11 volumes consisted entirely of letters from `` working people '' expressing outrage at the show and demanding that the artists be punished .
Almost none of the writers had seen the exhibition - most had signed form letters .
`` The events around the exhibition discredit the Russian Orthodox Church , just as the fatwah condemning Salman Rushdie to death discredited Islam , '' said Elena Bonner , Andrei Sakharov 's widow .
The outcome of the court hearings is difficult to predict , but it will answer the question of whether Russians have lost the freedom artistic self-expression that they gained after communism 's fall .
Disillusion with `` democracy Boris Yeltsin-style '' has pushed President Vladimir Putin to search for an ideology based on nationalism and the glorification of the state .
Putin calls it `` managed pluralism . ''
As we can now see , the Social Committee For the Moral Revival of the Fatherland wants to be among the managers .
The Islamic Case for Religious Liberty
The Islamic Case for Religious Liberty ANKARA -- Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew of the Orthodox Church recently said on American TV that he feels `` crucified '' in Turkey , upsetting many Turks .
Sadly , his Holiness is right .
Yet his complaint is not with Islam but with the secular Turkish Republic .
The Turkish state has kept the Halki Seminary , the only institution able to train Orthodox priests , closed since 1971 .
Even the Patriarch 's title `` ecumenical '' is lashed out at by some Turkish authorities and their nationalist supporters .
Every year , international reports on religious freedom point to such pressures on the Patriarchate with concern , and they are right to do so .
But why does Turkey do all this ?
Things were better long ago .
The first Turkish ruler to reign over the Ecumenical Patriarchate was Mehmed II , the Ottoman Sultan who conquered Constantinople in 1453 .
In line with the Islamic tradition of accepting the `` People of the Book , '' the young sultan granted amnesty to the patriarchate .
He also gave the institution many privileges and authorities , no less than that which existed under the Byzantine emperors .
Armenians and Jews later enjoyed the same autonomies .
In the 19th century , the non-Muslim peoples of the empire also achieved the rights of equal citizenship with Muslims .
That 's why the late Ottoman bureaucracy and the Ottoman Parliament included a great number of Greeks , Armenians and Jews -- something you never see in republican Turkey .
The Halki Seminary , opened in 1844 , is a relic from that bygone age of pluralism .
Nationalism is what destroyed this Pax Ottomana .
It affected the peoples of the empire one by one , including , towards the end , the Turks .
Many conflicts took place between the latter and the rest , and the great empire 's colossal collapse left a bitter taste in the mouths of all .
The Armenians , who suffered the worst tragedy in 1915 , never forgot nor forgave .
What the Turks remember , however , was the perceived `` treason '' of the other components of the empire , especially that of the Ecumenical Patriarchate . The latter had cheered the Greek armies when they invaded western Anatolia in 1919 .
When Mustafa Kemal Atatürk founded the Republic in 1923 , he defined the Patriarchate as `` a center of perfidy . ''
As an alternative , he promoted a rival `` Turkish Orthodox Patriarchate , '' which became a bastion of ultra-nationalist ideology .
-LRB- Some members of this artificial `` Patriarchate '' are currently on trial in the so-called Ergenekon case , a covert network of officers and civilians accused at conspiring to stage a military coup against the current Turkish government . -RRB-
Over the years , Atatürk 's ideas evolved into an official ideology called `` Kemalism , '' which had two main pillars : A self-styled secularism that bans anything but `` the secular way of life , '' and a fierce nationalism that defies anything it deems `` non-Turkish . ''
The Ecumenical Patriarchate , as both a religious and `` non-Turkish '' institution , fits in neither category .
Hence , throughout the Republican regime , and especially at times of military dominance , it faced official pressure and confiscation of property , as did all other non-Muslim and Muslim religious institutions .
So part of the problem is the curse of history .
But you can either trap yourself inside history or take lessons from it and move on .
To date , unfortunately , Turkey 's nationalists , within both state and society , have opted for the former option .
If one cause of the repression of the Ecumenical Patriarchate is nationalism , though , the other one is the other pillar of the Kemalist ideology : secularism .
Turkey ' draconian laws on `` national education '' ban any sort of religious education unless it is strictly controlled by the state .
The real motive behind this is the regime 's distaste for Islam .
The Ecumenical Patriarchate , as a foreign observer observes , only receives `` collateral damage . ''
A telling manifestation of this was seen recently in a live discussion on CNNTurk , the Turkish counterpart of the international news channel .
A deputy from the CHP , the staunchly Kemalist People 's Republican Party , Muharrem ?nce , who opposed the reopening of the Halki Seminary became angry . `` Do you know who most wants to open the seminary in this country , '' he loudly asked .
They want this , because they want to open Islamic schools as well . ''
Yes , this is indeed the position increasingly adopted by Turkey 's Islamic opinion leaders -- who are striving not for jihad or an `` Islamic state , '' but just a modest preservation of tradition .
They realize that religious freedom must be championed for all .
This more liberal approach to non-Muslims can be observed in today 's AKP -LRB- Justice and Development Party -RRB- government , in power since 2002 .
Although labeled as `` Islamist '' by its opponents , the AKP has been much more willing to liberalize Turkey than its secular counterparts , most of which are zealously nationalist .
The Annual Report of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom makes this point nicely :
`` In November 2006 , the -LRB- AKP dominated -RRB- Turkish parliament , as part of the reforms related to possible EU accession , passed a new law governing Lausanne religious minority foundations , easing procedures to establish foundations and allowing non-Turkish citizens in Turkey to open them ... Then President Ahmet Necdet Sezer -LRB- a staunch Kemalist -RRB- , however , vetoed the legislation .
In February 2008 , the parliament passed a similar law on the return of property confiscated from non-Muslim minorities ...
President Gül signed the legislation , which was also supported by Prime Minister Erdogan , but was vehemently opposed by Turkish nationalists on the grounds that the law granted too many rights to minority communities . ''
The Ecumenical Patriarch himself acknowledged in a recent interview that the AKP has shown goodwill on this issue . His All Holiness also said that the real obstacle is probably `` the deep state '' -- a reference to Turkey 's Kemalist state establishment that considers itself above any elected government and democratic law .
Homeless in Iraq BAGHDAD &#45; &#45; American officials report that the number of sectarian and other killings in Iraq has declined since the onset of the military `` surge . ''
But , while the number of killings may , indeed , have fallen , does that mean Iraq is really safer ?
Insecurity in Iraq is most strikingly illustrated by the number of people fleeing their homes .
The United Nations estimates that , since July , the number has risen by 60,000 every month .
The best estimate is that around 16 % of Iraq 's population , or one in six Iraqis , no longer live in their homes .
Roughly half of those who have fled have also left the country , implying two million refugees .
This leaves another two million who have been displaced internally , and who represent an emerging humanitarian tragedy .
There have been international reports and fundraising campaigns to support Iraqi refugees in Syria and Jordan , but the internally displaced have received less attention , despite their greater vulnerability , owing to their proximity to the conflict and the poor standard of basic services in Iraq .
They tend to be less visible , and it is more difficult for donors and agencies to assist them .
Internal displacement predates the 2003 Iraq invasion .
During former President Saddam Hussein 's rule , large numbers of people were forcibly relocated through either conflict or government policy .
Since 2003 , displacement has affected all the peoples of Iraq , and the central reason remains the same -- the use of violence to expel people from an area with the aim of increasing political and economic power .
Mixed neighborhoods across Iraq have been targeted by one side or another as sectarian violence has risen and local militias wield power .
The inability of the government or the multi-national force to curb this intimidation reflects the absence of the rule of law .
Other factors causing displacement include operations of the multinational force itself , crime , the lack of basic services , and desperate poverty .
The complexity of Iraq 's society and history means that many people have been displaced more than once , or have returned from exile only to become internally displaced .
According to the UN , 69 % of those displaced since February 2006 come from Baghdad , which demonstrates the extent of the `` sectarianization '' of the capital .
Thus , one reason for the `` success '' claimed by supporters of the military surge may well be that sectarian cleansing in Baghdad has been hugely effective and is now nearly complete .
Displaced Iraqis who remain in the country move to areas where their community is strong .
Displaced Shi'a tend to move from the center of the country to the south , Sunnis from the south to the center , and Christians to Nineveh province .
In mixed cities such as Baghdad and Baquba , those forced to move gravitate towards newly homogenized districts .
Most displaced people rent accommodation , stay with family or friends , or squat , while a smaller number take refuge in camps .
These people now account for many of the eight million Iraqis who are in absolute poverty and in need of emergency assistance .
Education is minimal , health care is inadequate , and many die without even being accounted for .
Whereas between 25 % and 40 % of Iraqis may require food assistance at any given time , this figure is much higher for displaced people , owing to their poor access to the public distribution system .
Only a third of the displaced had access to the system last year , while half reported receiving food rations only occasionally .
It is a new phenomenon in Iraq to see people , particularly women and children , looking in the rubbish every day for something to eat .
In such conditions , many young people feel they have little choice but to join violent groups , if only to provide some income and a level of protection .
Female-headed households , in particular , face great difficulties in protecting and supporting their families .
There are increasing reports of Iraqi women resorting to prostitution and of trafficking in women and children to neighboring countries .
The government recently announced the extension of a program of emergency cash allowances to widows .
However , this is insufficient to help most of the three million widows , while corruption and bureaucratic inefficiency hamper efforts further .
Another tragedy of the current conflict has been its impact on minority communities , which make up 10 % of the population and are targets for eradication .
Violent attacks have caused a huge exodus , jeopardizing the existence of Christians , Yazidis , and Mandeans , who have lived in Iraq for hundreds of years .
Despite the vulnerability of minorities , the religious breakdown of displaced people closely reflects that of the country : 64 % Shi'a , 32 % Sunni , and 4 % Christian .
But the ethnic breakdown of displaced people -- 93 % Arab , 4 % Assyrian , and 1 % Kurd -- illustrates the grave insecurity in central Iraq and the relative stability of Kurdistan .
With the prospects of return continuing to deteriorate , prolonged displacement may well become permanent .
Should levels of displacement remain high , as appears likely , the humanitarian crisis may deepen further , especially because strained local resources have led some governorates to begin refusing to admit displaced people .
Their predicament , too , must be reflected in any calculation of Iraq 's security conditions .
A Star is Jailed
A Star is Jailed BANGKOK -- Joseph Estrada , the disgraced former president of the Philippines , faces the prospect of spending his remaining years in prison after a special court in Manila found him guilty of amassing around US$ 15 million in bribes and kickbacks .
During the 30 months he ruled his country , from mid-1998 to the start of 2001 , Estrada accepted payoffs from gambling lords and orchestrated -LRB- with social security funds -RRB- sales of stocks , channeling much of the profits into his personal aliased account .
Estrada literally defined plunder : as a senator in the early 1990 's , he was a member of the congress that crafted the law under which he was convicted .
For many Filipinos , there is more than enough poetry in this fact , and certainly more irony than Estrada 's action-comedy movies of the 1960 's ever mustered .
There is no underplaying the significance of the court 's unanimous decision to convict the first Philippine president ever to undergo a criminal trial .
This is , after all , the Philippines , where Imelda Marcos is still living free and easy .
Despite massive evidence of the widespread death , poverty , suffering , and dysfunction she and her late husband , the dictator Ferdinand Marcos , inflicted on the Philippines , the only real disappointment she has subsequently endured has been losing the last presidential election she was allowed to contest .
The Philippines is not a country used to seeing powerful people punished .
When officials are accused or suspected of corruption , they do not quickly resign , as in Korea or Japan .
Instead , they often seek immunity by running for public office .
When a bloody coup against Corazon Aquino 's fledgling democratic government failed , the leader of the putsch escaped from a floating prison -- and then successfully ran for senator .
The wheels of Philippine justice need retooling , so much so that the country 's Chief Justice himself recently called for an emergency summit to discuss a rash of extra-judicial killings that have the claimed the lives of leftists , human rights workers , and journalists under President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo .
There have been few convictions for these crimes .
Yet Filipinos themselves simply can not seem to imagine their leaders behind bars .
Even before Estrada 's conviction , opinion polls showed that 48 % of Filipinos wanted clemency , if not a guaranteed pardon from Arroyo .
More than 80 % said Estrada should be allowed to languish in a lush private family vacation home where he already spent the last six years awaiting his verdict .
Is this lack of appetite for justice a part of Filipino culture , or learned behavior ?
Has an overly forgiving nature prevented Filipinos from achieving closure in so many painful chapters of their history , or are the ravages of impunity to blame ?
With so few examples of justice clearly dispensed , and overwhelmed by examples of villains so easily forgiven or forgotten , perhaps Filipinos could not bring themselves to demand what they could not imagine .
Estrada 's conviction gives Filipinos the clearest illustration of what the rule of law may bring to their society .
Estrada remains adored by the masses , but so far the public 's reaction to the verdict has been nonviolent and almost subdued .
Notwithstanding the opinion polls , it does seem as though the public not only accepts his conviction , but that they respect it as the outcome of a fair system that has been allowed to work .
This suggests not only that justice in the Philippines has a chance ; equally important , it suggests that Filipinos will give justice a chance .
If the Estrada saga leads to a firm yet dignified exercise of justice , Filipinos may discover a taste for more of the same .
Russia is Burning
MOSCOW -- For over a month , Moscow has been boiling in 40-degree -LRB- 100 degrees Fahrenheit -RRB- heat and heavy , sticky , eye-burning smog .
Carbon monoxide levels have reached crisis levels , at six times the maximum allowable concentration .
Other toxic substances in Moscow 's air are at nine times the normal level .
In early August , a journalist called the office of Moscow 's mayor , seeking comments on the situation . `` The office is closed , '' a woman at the press office answered , adding that smog had gotten inside the mayoral building , which is located less than two miles from the Kremlin , so everyone was ordered to go home .
`` Is it at all possible to get a comment from Mayor Yuri Luzhkov ? '' the reporter asked . `` He is not in Moscow , '' the woman replied .
Indeed , there are reports that the mayor 's press secretary has been telling journalists that there is no reason for the mayor to return to Moscow . `` Why should he ? '' said the secretary .
At the same time , a doctor from a local hospital was writing on his blog : `` It is a disaster .
There is no air conditioning in the hospital , no ventilators working , smog is penetrating everywhere , including the emergency room 's operating theater .
Each day , 16-17 people die .
The morgue is full , and there are not enough refrigerators for the dead -- they just put bodies along the walls . ''
Indeed , according to the Moscow City Health Department , the death rate has doubled over the past few weeks .
And yet Moscow 's mayor chose to remain on vacation outside the country .
Thankfully , comments coming from Luzhkov 's press office caused such a public outrage that the mayor cut short his holiday to return to the city .
One wonders what would have happened if Luzhkov needed to face re-election -LRB- his term expires in October 2011 -RRB- .
Would he have allowed himself such a vacation while his city was being ravaged by heat and toxic smog ?
Of course not .
But neither Luzhkov , nor whoever may replace him , must worry about voter approval , as the Kremlin appoints Moscow 's mayor , rather than allowing for free and fair elections -- a practice instituted a few years back by then-President Vladimir Putin for all such important positions across Russia .
Another example of this is the Nizhniy Novgorod region , just 400 kilometers -LRB- 250 miles -RRB- east of Moscow , which has been hit hard by the heat wave and fire .
At least 36 people , including 7 children , have lost their lives in this region -LRB- in total 52 people have died in the European part of Russia due to fire -RRB- , and more than 1,000 people have lost their homes and livelihoods .
Rare candid footage of Prime Minister Putin , displayed on government channels , depicted him visiting one of the towns in the region .
People who had lost their homes , clothing , and everything else were complaining to Putin that the regional and local government did not warn them that the fire was coming .
There were practically no fire trucks .
In many towns and villages , there was no electricity , so water pumps were not operable . `` No one even tried to save us , '' they wailed to Putin , who was accompanied by the regional governor , Valery Shantsev .
A week later , an inauguration ceremony officially began Shantsev 's second term in office .
Like all other Russian governors , he was not elected by those who live in his region -LRB- before becoming governor , he was Luzhkov 's deputy -RRB- .
He was appointed by the president , and thus bears no accountability whatsoever to those he is supposed to serve .
The fires in the European part of Russia have destroyed 190,000 hectares of forest .
Forestry specialists blame a carelessly enacted 2007 law that cut 90 % of forest guards .
The law was proposed by the government and quickly passed by the Duma , where Putin 's party controls two-thirds of the votes .
Shortly before the vote , the speaker of the Duma proclaimed that parliament is not a place for deliberation .
Hence , the legislation was passed without any second thought or discussion -- and Russians are now facing the consequences .
Russia 's burning summer of 2010 underscores something that political scientists everywhere acknowledge .
Authoritarian regimes , owing to their lack of accountability , are dreadful at coping with anomalous situations .
By controlling the mass media -- television first and foremost -- the leaders in such counties lack the ability to envisage and calculate possible risks .
Unfortunately , ordinary Russians have yet to connect the dots : the tragic situation in which they find themselves stems directly from how they voted in the past .
The political apathy that characterizes today 's Russia presents a serious challenge to the country 's survival .
But it seems that this apathy is beginning to lift .
The burning summer of 2010 may help Russians to understand that their very existence depends on whether the authorities can provide assistance in times of emergency .
A regime that can not respond to its citizens ' basic needs has no legitimacy at all .
The Globalization of Science
The Globalization of Science SAN FRANCISCO -- Science provides an invaluable source of guidance to individuals and governments .
This is true , in part , because scientists can often predict the future consequences of current actions .
For example , we know that someone who smokes two packs of cigarettes a day is likely to have a serious problem with cancer some 40 years later .
And science predicts that , unless we severely constrain consumption of oil and coal around the world , the climate will continue to warm , increasing ocean volume and melting huge amounts of ice in the Arctic and Antarctic -- thereby causing disastrous rises in sea level .
And yet , what science knows is far too often overlooked when high-stakes decisions are made .
This is not to say that scientists should dominate the government decision-making process .
It is the business of politicians , not scientists , to consider the relative costs and benefits of the options before them , weighing them as they see fit in reaching their conclusions .
But many such judgments will be poor ones without effective scientific input .
For example , the United States government is well-served by an organization called the National Academies , based on three honorary organizations composed of the nation 's most distinguished scientists , engineers , and health professionals -LRB- the National Academy of Sciences , National Academy of Engineering , and Institute of Medicine , respectively -RRB- .
This independent , non-governmental organization produces more than 200 reports a year , most in response to specific requests from the US government .
These requests range from questions about the health hazards of trace amounts of arsenic in drinking water , to questions about how best to support various forms of scientific research .
Through a rigorous review process , the Academies insist that each report be limited to what science can say about the subject based on evidence and logic , without preempting the decisions that need to be made by others .
Thus , for example , the report on drinking water predicted the frequency of bladder cancers that would eventually occur in a population exposed to levels of five , 10 , or 20 parts per billion of arsenic .
But it did not say what maximum arsenic concentration the government should legislate .
However , there are other important science-based issues that require study by internationally-based organizations in order to be widely accepted .
To meet this need , the InterAcademy Council -LRB- IAC -RRB- in Amsterdam was founded in 2000 by a worldwide organization of science academies called the InterAcademy Panel -LRB- IAP -RRB- .
The IAC is governed by a Board that includes a rotating group of 15 Academy presidents from around the world , representing nations at a range of economic development levels , and its reports present a truly international perspective backed by the world 's best scientists and engineers .
Inventing a Better Future also provided detailed guidance to governments and international organizations on how to build institutional capacities for science and technology in both developing and industrialized countries .
The IAC 's most recent effort , entitled Lighting the Way : Toward a Sustainable Energy Future , presents an ambitious science-based agenda for meeting the world 's enormously challenging energy requirements .
An important audience for each IAC report are the 100 academies of science that belong to the IAP . Each has a special responsibility for disseminating a report 's recommendations throughout its own country , which can considerably enhance the academy 's effectiveness in influencing national policies .
The combination of the IAP and the IAC is an important new experiment for providing international scientific advice -- an experiment that has only just begun to demonstrate its potential effectiveness for spreading the benefits of science and technology to all humanity .
The Rise and Fall of Putinism
The Rise and Fall of Putinism MOSCOW -- How did `` Putinism '' -- that distinctively Russian blend of authoritarian politics and dirigiste economics -- happen ?
And , now that it has , how can Russians move beyond it , to realize the rights and liberties promised to them in the country 's constitution ?
An active Russian civil society , which seemed to appear out of nowhere in Mikhail Gorbachev 's Soviet Union of 1989-1990 after the long Soviet hibernation , receded far too quickly .
The astounding difficulty of everyday survival following the USSR 's collapse trapped most Russians into focusing on their families ' most urgent needs .
Civic apathy set in .
So Vladimir Putin came to power at a very convenient moment for any ruler -- when the people are quiescent .
Cunningly , Putin then strapped this apathy to the first shoots of post-Soviet economic growth in order to conclude a new social contract : he would raise living standards in exchange for ordinary Russians ' acceptance of severe limits on their constitutional rights and liberties .
Until recently , both sides adhered to this tacit contract .
But , with the global financial crisis , the Kremlin stopped meeting its side of the bargain .
Thus , a new social contract is needed , especially as a new , post-Soviet generation of Russians has entered political life -- a generation that has not been poisoned by the fear that decades of state terror in the USSR implanted in their forebears .
Putin and his entourage `` tightened the screws '' on Russia 's people over the past decade , and faced almost no resistance to their claims to unchecked power .
Now , from the entire spectrum of civil and political rights enumerated in Russia 's Constitution , we Russians have only one right remaining : the right to leave and return to the country freely .
All other rights have been lost or substantially weakened .
But Russian citizens , especially younger ones , are beginning to realize what they have lost .
By the same token , the post-Soviet generation has a very different idea of a decent standard of living than their parents had , and hence their aspirations are much higher .
Many have traveled abroad , and all have seen foreign films , from which they have learned that people of their social status in the West have a far more comfortable life than they do .
The majority of Soviet people did not have a car or a country house or even a separate apartment .
Now the young feel deprived if they ca n't have all of that .
At first , people did not think of civil rights as they strove for such previously unknown comforts .
They relied on the Kremlin to set the conditions that would give them new opportunities .
Now , they are gradually coming to understand that the government has failed them .
A struggle for the restitution of constitutional rights in Russia first became noticeable in 2009 .
At Triumph Square in Moscow , protestors have consistently demanded that Article 31 , which guarantees the right to peaceful assembly , be respected .
Movement-31 , an umbrella grouping of like-minded protestors , has spread rapidly , staging simultaneous demonstrations in Moscow and 48 other cities two months ago in support of the right to free assembly .
There have been simultaneous protests in the past , but usually against increases in rent or utility charges .
One can understand why the demand to comply with Article 31 has gained popular support .
For ordinary citizens , who have neither access to the media nor personal contacts with the authorities , protests are an opportunity to inform officials of their demands , requests , and suggestions .
There are also other signs of awakening civic engagement , which are particularly evident in Internet discussions , which the Kremlin can not control in the same way that it does other Russian media .
Citizens have started to use the Internet for self-organization , for example , to generate simultaneous `` flash mobs , '' as well as protests by automobile owners , in different cities .
Most recently , the Internet has become a means of public control over civil-rights violations by the authorities , as images taken with mobile phones become available instantaneously to all .
The authorities have to reckon with the fallout , punishing officials who have come into the spotlight this way .
Russia 's federal government and regional authorities are clearly alarmed by this rapidly growing civic activism .
But , despite changed conditions , they respond with the same old methods -- suppression , intimidation , and misinformation .
And , with elections to the State Duma due in December 2011 , followed by the presidential election in March 2012 , officials are particularly concerned by an upsurge of civic activism .
It is not hard to see why .
Over the past decade , the electoral system was `` improved '' in such a way that no outcome can lead to a change in the federal government .
That leaves street demonstrations and other forms of civic activism as the only way to challenge Putinism 's standard-bearers .
Indeed , given state control of the mainstream media , such activism may be the only way to learn what citizens really think about their rulers .
Checks and Balances in an EU Constitution .
Checks and Balances in an EU Constitution .
EU Commission President Romano Prodi has proposed a scheme to strengthen the Union 's executive .
Britain , France , and Spain are working on an opposing plan that will consolidate EU executive powers among the biggest EU states .
What 's the ordinary European to think ?
Europe 's citizens scarcely grasp the issues at the heart of the European Constitutional Convention in Brussels .
Mountains of detail obscure problems ; sterile , misleading national discussions that pit `` Euroskeptics '' against `` Europhiles '' muster sound and fury but clarify nothing .
So complicated do many issues seem that some newspapers and broadcasters have abandoned reporting about the Convention .
EU citizens can secure a clearer understanding of what the Convention should achieve by asking this question : how should governmental functions be divided between the EU and its member nations ?
To answer this , we need to grasp government 's true purpose .
Government should provide citizens with public goods : collective defense , legislation and regulation , enforcement of the rule of law .
These can be provided at different levels : local , regional , national , or supranational government , i.e. , the EU .
But what is the right level ?
In some areas , decentralization works because it recognizes diverse local or national communities .
The lower a government activity 's externalities , the more it should be localized .
Low externalities imply limited benefits to be gained from centralization ; deep differences among citizens imply that the costs of harmonization would be too high .
The euro , for example , delivers clear advantages of scale by favoring international commerce and avoiding negative externalities .
In educational policy , however , to impose the same system on all members would not create economies of scale .
Cultural differences are too strong to win voluntary compliance . It would be absurd to delegate education and culture to a supranational level .
Of the areas of public policy with high economies of scale or externalities , two stand out : the common market and competition ; and foreign policy and defense .
The former covers antitrust , trade , and the common currency .
Some think that fiscal policies - from the structure of taxation to welfare , to budget balances - should also be harmonized .
But national preferences are diverse , and if mechanically imposed , fiscal centralization might incite resistance .
Nor do centralized fiscal policies have any real raison d'être from a constitutional point of view .
The US Constitution , for example , does not prescribe balanced budgets for the states .
Only in exceptional circumstances is fiscal harmonization justified : prohibitions , say , on fiscal incentives aimed at limiting competition , impeding commerce , or restricting the movement of capital .
Foreign policy and defense belong , par excellence , at government 's apex . There are clear externalities and economies of scale .
It would be absurd if New York pursued a different foreign policy than Texas .
Much the same is true in Europe .
The addition of new EU members implies that more internal differences will occur , which means that fewer centralized policies are justified .
These considerations suggest a series of principles for the Convention to consider :
1 .
The EU Constitution should establish unequivocally which prerogatives belong to Europe and which to member countries .
When in doubt , the principle of subsidiarity suggests that national states remain supreme ;
2 .
European-level institutions should guarantee the functioning of markets , including competition , commercial , and monetary policies ;
3 .
Fiscal policy should remain largely decentralized , save for a few exceptions ;
4 .
Foreign policy and defense are areas of federal competence , to be delegated to Europe at a proper time ;
5 .
The creation of new areas of federal competence should be accompanied by decision-making mechanisms found in genuinely representative democracies .
So `` No centralization without representation . ''
Today 's EU diverges enormously from these principles -LRB- see table -RRB- , as is demonstrated by the fact that agriculture , which represents 2 % of European GDP , accounts for 40 % of EU expenditures . Activities of EU Institutions -LRB- percent of total -RRB- Source of Table : `` What Does the European Union do ? ''
A. Alesina , I. Angeloni & L. Schuknecht , CEPR Discussion Paper no.
Europe faces an historic opportunity .
America 's founding fathers wrote a Constitution that has lasted over 200 years .
Members of the European Convention obviously face a far more complex and diverse society-and thus a more daunting constitutional challenge .
But they can succeed by displaying comparable wisdom and foresight .
Managing Iraq 's Oil
Managing Iraq 's Oil
In recent months , Iraq 's oil production has grown to more than two million barrels per day . At this rate , current oil output and oil exports now exceed post-invasion predictions .
Experts had argued that funding shortages , lack of security , the problems of stabilizing a legitimate government , and technology shortfalls would severely limit Iraq 's output .
Despite the odds , Iraq 's daily output reached a post-invasion record of 2.5 million barrels in March .
Most significantly , the Bush administration gave Iraq $ 2.3 billion to restore its oil production .
After the invasion , no one expected Iraq to get loans , let alone outright grants .
Instead , $ 2.3 billion was invested directly into the Iraqi oil sector .
To protect the oil fields and other facilities , the Americans dedicated a massive , overwhelming force of soldiers and private contractors .
The level of protection was unprecedented even compared to Saddam 's regime .
Finally , high oil prices in the past 12 months provided an unexpectedly large windfall to the Iraqi budget , allowing for the financing of other sectors without slighting the oil industry .
High prices also enabled the Coalition Provisional Authority to add even more private security personnel to protect refineries and pipelines .
Granting Iraq the money to restore its oil industry was one of the best post-war decisions that the Bush administration has made .
The money allowed Iraq to begin to address security , production , and technology issues throughout its oil system .
But the question remains : will output growth continue following the transfer of sovereignty to an Iraqi government at the end of June ?
Despite massive injections of funds and unprecedented security , insurgents have still managed to halt or reduce oil production and exports several times since the invasion .
The bombing of a pipeline or other oil facility somewhere in Iraq remains almost a daily occurrence , and the transfer of power has not reduced these attacks so far .
At the same time , maintaining the flow of funds into the Iraqi oil sector is essential , not only for its growth , but for its very survival .
Money brings technological regeneration as well as security .
Under even the best circumstances for Iraq , with oil prices remaining high , the funds available to maintain and modernize the oil industry are limited .
If oil prices decline in the future , the oil industry will suffer severely .
This makes for an interesting relationship between Iraq and Saudi Arabia .
Only Saudi Arabia can manage the global output of oil in such a way that will make room for Iraqi oil and keep prices high .
A decline in oil revenues could be devastating to the fledgling Iraqi government .
Current oil revenues are barely enough to cover state expenses , let alone pay for reconstruction , debt , and war reparations .
Even if President Bush wins reelection , it is highly unlikely that the US will make another outright grant to a sovereign Iraq .
Theoretically , international loans could be an alternative , but who would lend to an unstable government , let alone a government whose legitimacy has not been fully established ?
Likewise , privatization is out of the picture for now .
The new government will have to make do and chart a slow path for its oil recovery , just as Saddam 's regime did .
At the same time , the logic of renewed American support for the Iraqi oil industry remains powerful .
Only grants from the US will reduce output volatility .
Saddam 's regime caused most of the volatility in the oil market in the last 30 years .
In fact , every peak in oil prices since 1973 was caused by an event related to Iraq .
One would hope that his removal would reduce market volatility and stabilize oil prices .
Unfortunately , Iraq appears set to continue to be a major source of high oil prices , owing to highly erratic output .
For the foreseeable future , one of the principal outcomes of the invasion of Iraq will be greater volatility and thus higher prices .
The Perilous Fantasy of Energy Independence
The Perilous Fantasy of Energy Independence The paradox of today 's quest for energy independence is that pursuing it actually increases energy insecurity .
However much politicians who call for energy independence might prefer it otherwise , the market has chosen oil as a staple energy source .
So governments should ignore neither the valid interests of oil exporters , on whom consumers in their countries depend , nor exporters ' reaction to the rhetoric of energy independence or to steps taken to achieve it .
Isolationist politicians may not care about other countries , but they should think twice lest they harm their own .
The biggest threats to the world 's energy security are not terrorist attacks or embargoes by oil-producing countries -- short-term events that can be dealt with quickly and effectively through various measures , including reliance on strategic petroleum reserves , increases in production , and diversion of oil shipments .
Instead , the main threat to the long-term sustainability of energy supplies is the mismatch between investment in additional capacity and energy infrastructure , on one hand , and growth in demand for energy on the other .
An energy crisis in this case is almost certain if those who press for energy independence fail to provide a workable alternative in a timely manner .
Of course , these efforts will almost surely fail to replace oil within a reasonable time , as they are not market-driven and require heavy subsidies .
Indeed , confronted by political leaders ' hostile rhetoric , oil producers have a strong incentive to increase production in order to lower oil prices to levels that undermine the economic feasibility of alternative energy sources -- a logical interventionist policy to counter the anti-oil interventionist policies of consuming countries .
Even if the oil producing countries do not intentionally bring about an oil price collapse , they might accelerate production as much as they could in the short term , while oil still had some value .
But lower oil prices , coupled with expectations of a decline in demand , would in turn put pressure on oil-producing countries to reduce planned investments in production capacity or even to mothball major projects , as they have done in the past , leading to a decline in oil supplies .
Thus , if alternative energy technologies did not come on-line by the time oil production started to fall , global shortages would become inevitable , while closing the investment deficit would take years , even in the face of rising oil prices .
In spite of these possibilities , let 's assume that plans for energy independence succeed , and that several European countries , the United States , Japan , China , and India become self-sufficient .
Major oil exporters could then seek to use their now less-valuable oil at home as cheap fuel for an expanded heavy industrial sector .
Instead of exporting oil directly , they could export their energy embedded in metals , chemicals , and manufactured products at prices that undercut anything producers in the oil-consuming countries , especially Europe and the US , could match , given their dependence on higher-cost alternative energy sources .
Energy independence thus could destroy entire industries , especially petrochemicals , aluminum , and steel .
In fact , cheap energy in oil-producing countries might make their new industries competitive with those in China , India , and Southeast Asia .
The net result would be a loss of jobs and weakened economies .
Countries might end up energy-independent , only to become steel-dependent or petrochemical-dependent .
So what would come next ?
Would politicians , with their perpetual fascination with `` independence , '' attempt to eliminate dependence one commodity at a time ?
Put another way , would the cause of `` energy independence '' seek to reverse globalization ?
Oil is a finite resource .
Only long-term , market-oriented , economically viable , and sustainable energy options can ensure economic growth in both producing and consuming countries .
Isolationist policies , by contrast , always lead to shortages and discontent .
No matter how energy independence is pursued , it will never amount to anything other than an unattainable -- and potentially dangerous -- fantasy .
The Endless Iranian Nuclear Crisis
The Endless Iranian Nuclear Crisis Iran will continue to enrich uranium regardless of whether a Republican or a Democrat is America 's president .
At the same time , the United States will oppose any Iranian nuclear program -- even a civilian program -- because this will contribute to the stability of the regime in Tehran .
As a result , nuclear tensions are likely to bedevil US-Iranian relations for years to come .
Iran , it is often claimed , has no need for nuclear power , given its abundant oil and natural gas reserves .
But the Iranian government is under economic and political pressure to supply increasing amounts of electricity to its growing population and fragile economy .
Using oil or natural gas for domestic electricity threatens oil and gas exports , which are the principle source of government revenues .
Indeed , with domestic oil consumption growing at a higher rate than production , government revenues from oil exports are already in decline .
Thus , nuclear power will halt the decline in government revenues by freeing more oil and natural gas for export .
Iran 's natural gas resources , if developed , would not be a substitute for cheap nuclear power , because gas is more profitable in other uses than in power generation .
The Iranian government fears that electricity shortages , slow economic growth , and high unemployment will turn the populace against it .
As social tensions increase , political turmoil will follow .
Nuclear power offers the possibility of cheap , plentiful electricity , which will contribute to social and political stability .
Iranian experts argue that , in considering the trade-off between internal unrest and external sanctions , the Iranian government must choose between domestic security and international security .
Domestic pressure could very well bring down the regime , but international pressure will not .
History is on the side of the Iranian government .
The Islamic Revolution has survived a brutal war with Iraq , economic sanctions , and decades of international pressure and isolation from the US .
Moreover , Iran 's leaders remember that the Shah was forced to flee the country in 1979 , despite having strong international support .
While there may be security reasons for any future US administration to oppose even a civilian nuclear program , American policymakers also recognize the strategic impact that nuclear energy will have in stabilizing the Iranian regime .
The US and Iran have been fighting proxy wars since 1979 , and their ongoing conflict means that proxy wars will continue in Lebanon , Iraq , Afghanistan , and the Caspian Sea region , as will trade and investment wars .
Indeed , as long as China and Russia have money to invest and arms to sell , most UN sanctions will be toothless .
It is not in Iran 's interest , under any scenario , to decrease oil exports , let alone halt them .
However , domestic pressure , a sense of nationalism , and the need to improve its bargaining position with Western countries might force the Iranian government to respond to harsh UN sanctions or an air attack on its nuclear facilities .
But even under these extreme circumstances , Iran will still need its oil revenue .
A symbolic cut or embargo , while possible , would have little impact on world oil markets .
Iran 's government has more effective options to respond to attacks from the US and its allies .
Its supporters in Iraq might cripple Iraqi oil exports from Basra , which would damage US plans in Iraq while boosting Iran 's oil revenues , or limit the availability of fuel to the US Army by attacking roads and bridges , especially the Kuwait City-Baghdad highway .
The world community will continue to pay a high price for the nuclear standoff , which will cast a shadow over world oil markets for years to come .
Some experts argue that it has already raised oil prices by about $ 15 per barrel .
Ironically , an Iranian civilian nuclear program would enhance US and world energy security by making more oil and gas available in the global market .
But America 's determination to destabilize Iran and the Iranian government 's determination to retain power reduce the likelihood of this scenario .
How Does the Weak Dollar Affect Oil Prices ?
How Does the Weak Dollar Affect Oil Prices ?
Around the world , there is anguished hand-wringing about the high price of oil .
But if political leaders and policymakers want lower oil prices , they should be promoting policies that strengthen the dollar .
The implications of pricing oil in any single-currency are more far-reaching than most people think .
For example , some oil-producing countries ask their customers to pay in euros , but that does not mean that their oil is priced in euros .
And even if dollar prices were to be replaced by euro prices , the impact of single-currency pricing on the oil market would be the same .
While oil-exporting countries receive revenues in dollars -LRB- or their euro equivalent -RRB- , they use different currencies to import goods and services from various countries .
Any change in the exchange rate of the dollar affects the purchasing power of these countries , and therefore their real income .
Likewise , international oil companies sell most of their oil in dollars , but they operate in various countries and pay some of their costs in local currencies .
Any change in the value of the dollar therefore affects their cost structure and profitability . In turn , it affects reinvestment in exploration , development , and maintenance .
The relationship between the value of the dollar and oil prices is very complex .
While they can feed on each other to produce a vicious cycle , their short-term relationship is distinct from their long-term relationship .
In the short-term , dollar depreciation does not affect supply and demand , but it does affect speculation and investment in oil futures markets .
As the dollar declines , commodities -- including oil -- attract investors .
Investing in futures becomes both a hedge against a weakening dollar and an investment vehicle that could yield substantial profit , particularly in a climate of vanishing excess oil production capacity , increasing demand , declining interest rates , a slumping real estate market , and crisis in the banking industry .
OPEC might be correct to blame American policies and speculators for higher prices .
It is also correct that if OPEC had excess capacity , it would have already used it to flush out speculators to bring oil prices down .
OPEC can regain control in one of two ways : use its `` claimed '' excess capacity to flush out speculators , or use its financial surpluses to overtake them .
Recourse to the latter option means that , even without excess capacity , OPEC can still be in the driver 's seat .
In the long run , however , statistical analysis of various oil industry variables indicates that a weaker dollar affects supply by reducing production , regardless of whether oil is owned and produced by national or international oil companies .
A weak dollar also affects demand by increasing consumption .
The result of a decrease in supply and an increase in demand is higher prices .
The lower dollar also reduces the purchasing power of oil exporters .
If nominal oil prices remain constant while the dollar declines , the real income of the oil-producing countries declines , resulting in less investment in additional capacity and maintenance .
The same is true of oil companies .
Consequently , oil prices increase .
Indeed , because oil prices were rising while the dollar was declining , capacity expansion by oil firms failed to meet forecasts for non-OPEC production in the last three years .
Even oil production in the United States has not matched the increase in oil prices , as rising import costs for tools and equipment -- partly a reflection of the dollar 's weakness and other factors -- have forced project delays and cancellations .
Of course , the lower dollar means cheaper oil in Europe , Asia , and all countries with appreciating currencies .
Oil prices hit records in the US in 2004 and 2005 , but not in Europe , which partly explains why economic growth there has not been affected .
When Americans paid $ 120 per barrel , Europeans paid only about ¤ 76 per barrel .
Several factors have prevented high oil prices from affecting the demand for petroleum products in the US in recent years , such as increased government spending , low interest rates , tax breaks , and an increase in real incomes .
To be sure , the weaker dollar has forced some American families to spend their vacations in the US instead of Europe .
But , since many Americans use gas-guzzling SUV 's for their vacations , demand for gasoline has remained high .
UNESCO for Sale
COLUMBUS , OHIO -- In a better world , my nieces and nephews in Equatorial Guinea would respect our country 's president for overseeing the careful management of revenues pouring in from oil , and for using these funds for development .
In a better world , my nieces and nephews would honor the United Nations ' main cultural institution , UNESCO , for insisting on improving the education and health of Africa 's children .
But in the world as we know it , relatively few people love and respect President Teodoro Obiang .
His biggest fans might include the high-living members of his family , along with selected business executives in the United States and Europe , where he spends quite a bit of his money .
Or certain members of the UN Human Rights Council : during a session in March , some states had the gall to congratulate Equatorial Guinea for its `` unequivocal commitment '' to human rights .
Board members of UNESCO also seem to love and respect Obiang .
They have accepted $ 3 million from him for a prize named in his honor .
The prize is supposed to recognize the work of individuals and institutions , including non-governmental organizations , for scientific research in the life sciences that improves the quality of human life .
Perhaps the recipients will love Obiang , too .
It is easy to see where Obiang -- who seized power in Equatorial Guinea after killing his predecessor -- gets the money that he tosses around . Since the mid-1990 's , Equatorial Guinea has become a large oil exporter .
While Obiang and his family and cronies jet around the world living the high life , my nieces and nephews number among the vast majority of the country 's people who remain mired in poverty .
Child mortality is high .
Free and fair elections do not exist .
Arbitrary detention and torture are widespread .
The government allows almost no independent news and information .
In 2009 , the UN found that Equatorial Guinea had the world 's largest disparity between its per capita GDP ranking , which was on a par with Italy and Spain , and its level of human development -- close to Haiti 's .
My nieces and nephews have a life expectancy of 52 years .
According to the president 's son and heir-apparent , Teodorin Obiang , in Equatorial Guinea it is not illegal for a government minister to own a company and to submit bids for government contracts to the ministry that he or she controls .
Such brazen corruption would be laughable if its effects were not so debilitating to the country .
Among its avowed priorities , UNESCO lists gender equality , universal education , sustainable development , and ethics .
My nieces and nephews in Equatorial Guinea still go to school on an empty stomach .
They return home by mid-day to help supplement the household income by selling doughnuts in the streets -- at a time when they are supposed to be completing homework .
Surviving on less than a dollar a day , as most of my countrymen do , means living without running water , sanitation , or electricity .
Given the mountain of evidence of corruption and money-laundering by Obiang , his family , and his associates , as well as the deplorable living conditions that people in Equatorial Guinea endure , how is it possible that UNESCO agreed to accept Obiang 's money and name a prize in life sciences after him ?
What due diligence was conducted to ensure that the money it received to fund the prize was not actually stolen from the very Africans whose interests UNESCO claims to champion ?
As far as the people of Equatorial Guinea are concerned , by offering this prize , UNESCO lends credibility to Obiang and his regime , and becomes complicit in its abuses .
UNESCO -- not alone among UN entities -- seems more inclined to bend over backwards to avoid taking any action that might offend `` African sensibilities '' on its board .
One European ambassador was quoted as saying that African countries were all in favor of the prize , and they had enough supporters to take it forward .
The Obiang Prize is a mockery of everything UNESCO publicly stands for .
UNESCO remains unabashed . It has signaled no willingness to withdraw the award or investigate the origins of Obiang 's gift .
Would n't it be nice if UNESCO and its executive board -- particularly the board 's African members -- actually stood up for African people ?
Or maybe they love Obiang 's money more than they love my nieces and nephews .
Europe 's New Mission in Africa
Europe 's New Mission in Africa The EU 's military mission to ensure free and fair elections in the Democratic Republic of Congo -LRB- DRC -RRB- has shown what the European Security and Defense Policy -LRB- ESDP -RRB- can achieve in Africa .
A contingent of roughly 2,500 troops from 22 countries went to the DRC in mid-2003 to support United Nations troops , and provided a rapid reaction force that snuffed out disorder in Kinshasa before it could erupt into full-blown mayhem .
Three years later , Operation Artemis , a comparable EU mission in the eastern province of Ituri , again demonstrated Europe 's resolve to use its military capability to underpin a long-term peace process .
For some people , raw military might is the only true measure of power .
But the 16 EU military missions that have now been carried out in support of the ESDP have much more to commend them .
Large parts of Africa need support , and Europe can and must lend a hand .
Nor is the EU 's new style of political-military engagement in Africa a throwback to colonialism .
True , many African countries currently suffer from instability , state failure , regional strife , violent internal political competition , and other assorted ills , including , massacres and large-scale brutality , civil war , massive movements of refugees , economic disruption , and environmental damage .
Yet the big picture in Africa is not uniformly bleak .
Some African countries are comparatively stable and prosperous , and the Continent possesses a youthful population that will soon top one billion people , abundant mineral reserves , and an inherent dynamism .
At the same time , we in Europe can not afford to dismiss Africa 's troubles as if they had no impact on our own societies .
The European project has been built on values that we deem to be universal , and we must make a very real effort to uphold them , not only as a moral imperative , but also because it is in our strategic interest .
The EU is by far the largest export market for African goods , and it also offers a home to large communities from almost every African country .
Likewise , a large number of European citizens and dependents are scattered throughout Africa .
In the early stages of a crisis , European intervention -- through political and financial assistance , diplomatic intervention , and even military action -- can prevent it from erupting into violence .
Moreover , when a crisis is winding down and there are openings for moderating influences , outside intervention can prove instrumental in enforcing peace and bringing warring factions to the negotiating table .
In countries that have experienced the horrors of civil war , the arrival of an effective military force from outside is generally welcomed , as was the case in both the 2003 and 2006 Congo operations .
Just by virtue of being there , the force shows the goodwill and commitment of the nations that sent it , and , by projecting a sense of law and order , it provides valuable leverage for honest brokers trying to mediate a peace deal .
Europe 's policy toward Africa may suffer shortcomings , but at least there is a policy , which is based on supporting African states and regional organizations like the African Union whenever practicable , necessary and , above all , requested .
The ESDP takes into account the larger European policy , and aims to provide assistance in planning , training , and logistical support to missions and forces created by African states or groups of states .
For example , the recent concept of `` European reinforcement of African capabilities in prevention , crisis response and conflict resolution '' -LRB- which is known as ` Recamp ' -RRB- openly calls for African ownership of this process .
Europe has never claimed to have the means of redressing all the strategic imbalances that exist in Africa -- nor does it have any intention of doing so .
Yet , taken together , the EU countries possess a considerable array of assets , including the military capability needed to conduct decisive operations .
Yet their most valuable asset is cultural : soldiers who are willing and able to interact with the local population , who are cautious in their use of lethal force , and who are ready to accept the many shades of gray that exist between conflicting parties .
Nevertheless , European military capabilities are limited , requiring that European planners look for `` minimal '' options , with the drawback that smaller commitments generally require a long-term perspective .
The ESDP has not functioned long enough to establish a clear track record .
Yet our modest ongoing endeavors in Congo ? a police advisory mission known as EUPOL and a defense reform mission called EUSEC ? and in Sudan , where 60 Europeans are providing staff support to the African Union 's AMIS II mission in Darfur , offer grounds for hope .
The EU 's members must above all recognize that Africa 's ills have to be dealt with by Africans .
This is as much a matter of principle as of cold , strategic calculation , and it is here where the ESDP has much to offer : a long-term view , supported by a powerful economy with the assets needed to carry out humanitarian operations , conflict prevention , crisis management , and security support .
Foremost among the ESDP 's advantages is Europe 's cultural knowledge and understanding of Africa .
Today , former colonial powers have evolved significantly , just as have their former colonies .
On both shores of the Mediterranean , generations have passed and new connections have been formed .
It is the knowledge , understanding , and mutual respect that remain , and that are the cornerstones on which Europe 's policy for Africa must be built .
Losing Turkey OXFORD &#45; &#45; Turkey has long been a haven of geo-political stability .
Both the dominant Justice and Development Party -LRB- AKP -RRB- and its secular rivals remain publicly committed to pursuing EU membership , but in practice doubts have emerged .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy 's insistence that a referendum should be held on Turkey 's admission suggests that years of painful adjustment to EU norms will never produce the payoff of membership .
The US and the EU are evidently convinced that Turkey has nowhere else to go .
The Turks , they think , will fatalistically accept any snub .
But this cozy assumption overlooks a tectonic shift in Turkey 's geo-political position .
Immediately after the collapse of the Soviet Union , Turkey looked to the newly-independent central Asian states in a mood of pan-Turkic romanticism .
These ancestral homelands exercised a hold on Turkish imaginations , but today it is business opportunities , energy resources , and other practical matters rather than ethnic unity that are creating a loose Turkic `` commonwealth . ''
Most striking is Turkey 's renewal of relations with Russia without damaging its ties to the newly independent post-Soviet states .
Turkey 's ancient antagonism toward Russia briefly revived when the Soviet Union imploded .
In the early 1990 's , some Turkish generals saw the humiliation of Russian troops in Chechnya as part of a long-awaited revenge .
But , while Russia -LRB- and Iran -RRB- were once Turkey 's great geo-political rivals , today they are export markets and energy suppliers .
Energy is the key to Turkey 's new geo-political position .
Its industry and population are growing dynamically , so its energy demands are producing geo-political synergy with Russia and Iran , neither of which can afford to cut the flow of oil and gas without provoking a massive internal crisis .
Meanwhile , as Turkey 's attitude toward its neighbors has changed , its governing elite has watched the EU embrace ex-communist countries with far shakier market economies and shorter democratic records .
As one Turkish general put it , `` If we had joined the Warsaw Pact rather than NATO , we would be in the EU by now . ''
Last summer 's re-election of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan 's AKP , followed by the election of Abdullah Gul as the first president whose wife wears a headscarf , seemed to confirm the fears of anti-Islamic Europeans .
Yet , even if many AKP activists and voters are devout Muslims , Erdogan and Gul remain committed to European integration .
Time is running out , however , for them to satisfy their supporters and silence their critics by achieving it .
The problem is that the AKP 's victories , together with America 's courting of Erdogan and Gul , have triggered a crisis of direction among Turkey 's once-dominant secular and pro-western elite .
Even if the AKP can rely on the allegiance of millions of voters and swarms of new members anxious to join the winning side , the secularists are deeply entrenched in Turkey 's institutions , universities , media , and business .
But both ordinary AKP supporters and disillusioned secularists are now suspicious of America 's actions and motives in the region .
Key military figures ' tacit backing for the Turkish Parliament 's refusal to endorse the March 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq suggests that Turkish nationalism could unite the AKP 's rank-and-file MPs with their otherwise implacable foes in the secular camp .
If the EU were to snub Turkey openly over membership , or if America were to seem too lax on the Kurdish problem in Northern Iraq , a huge swathe of the two camps could well unite .
Turkey 's links with Israel , for example , have been strained by Israeli investment in Kurdistan .
While Shimon Peres made a gesture of reconciliation by choosing Ankara as the setting for the first speech by an Israeli president to the parliament of a predominantly Muslim country , Israel 's concerns about Iran are far more serious than are Turkey 's .
Israel 's two most irreconcilable enemies , Iran and Syria , are in fact among the most vocal supporters of Turkey 's hard-line stance towards the Kurds .
America 's conquest of Iraq de-stabilized Turkey 's Western orientation more than the US cares to admit .
Most Turks do n't want to see their country excluded from the West , but if the EU spurns them while speeding up entry for weaker candidates , Turkey may come to feel sufficiently strong and embittered to strike out on a new geo-political course .
The Euro Ark
The Euro Ark BRUSSELS -- The euro is celebrating its tenth anniversary against the background of the most difficult economic climate since its birth .
The financial storm that swept in from the United States , and the onset of a severe economic downturn , confronts Europe with unprecedented challenges .
Faced with the biggest test in its history , the euro is far from steering into disaster , as the Nobel laureate economist Milton Friedman predicted ten years ago .
On the contrary , Europe 's Economic and Monetary Union is proving a major asset in these tumultuous times .
Doubters should remember that the euro was itself born out of crisis .
The single currency was conceived as an answer to the upheavals of the postwar period -- double-digit inflation , high unemployment , and speculative attacks on the pound , the lira , and the French franc .
It was the crisis of the European Monetary System that drove the euro 's launch on January 1 , 1999 .
In ten short years , the euro revolutionized the global economic environment , rising to the status of the world 's second currency and rivaling the dollar as a medium for international trade and finance .
The EMU is now the world 's largest market , and continues to grow .
With Slovakia 's entry on January 1 , the euro spans 16 countries and 329 million citizens .
The benefits of a monetary union based on a stable macroeconomic framework and governed by an independent central bank are manifest : the euro area has enjoyed low inflation and low interest rates for much of the last decade , a boost in trade and investment , and rapid integration of financial markets .
Moreover , 16 million jobs have been created over the last 10 years -- a record more successful than even the US .
Today 's financial turmoil and economic downturn are highlighting the EMU 's advantages in several important ways .
First , the euro has eliminated the possibility of exchange-rate turbulence and speculative currency attacks that more vulnerable economies could have expected in the current turmoil .
As a stable and strong world currency , the euro is also limiting exchange-rate instability globally .
Second , the euro area benefits from an independent European Central Bank whose swift actions to ease liquidity constraints and coordinate monetary policy have recently helped to avert a financial meltdown .
Such rapid , coordinated steps by 16 national central banks would have been unthinkable .
Third , the EMU 's stability-oriented macroeconomic framework has better prepared euro-area countries for economic storms .
Thanks to the fiscal rules of the Stability and Growth Pact , the euro area achieved its soundest budgetary position in 2007 , bringing deficits to their lowest levels in 25 years .
This allowed many European Union countries to approach the crisis with room for maneuver .
Such are the EMU 's benefits that the visible costs of remaining a non-member are beginning to recast the political debate surrounding euro adoption in several countries .
Of course , the euro is no panacea , nor has it functioned perfectly over the last decade .
Divergences between euro-area economies in terms of growth and inflation have been a persistent challenge .
Though differences are no bigger than those found within larger economies such as the US or Germany , they risk being amplified by the crisis .
This is why it is even more important that we continue to improve the EMU 's functioning .
This requires not just reinforcing resilience in the face of crisis , but also equipping euro-area economies for the longer-term challenges of globalization , aging , resource scarcity , and climate change .
In a potentially more volatile twenty-first century global economy , we must reap the maximum benefits of economic integration in terms of growth and jobs .
The key to a better functioning EMU is closer surveillance and deeper coordination of economic policies .
Leaders must start living up to the responsibilities that come with sharing a single currency .
They must recognize the impact that national economic policies have on the euro area as a whole , and thus discuss and coordinate economic programs at the euro-area level .
Here , the launch of the European Economic Recovery Plan -- the initiative for an EU-wide fiscal stimulus equivalent to 1.5 % of GDP , endorsed by the European Heads of Government in December -- constitutes a major step forward .
This must now be followed by closer budgetary monitoring , particularly given that fiscal stimulus measures , the economic downturn , and bank rescue plans will take a toll on public finances .
The Stability and Growth Pact must remain the cornerstone of the EU 's budgetary framework , and effective surveillance and peer support will be vital to help member states work towards balanced budgets once the economy rebounds .
Deeper fiscal surveillance should be matched by broader economic surveillance , especially since current-account imbalances have become more acute during the crisis .
The European Commission is now working on extending the focus of surveillance beyond fiscal policy so that we can identify risks stemming from macroeconomic imbalances or changes in competitiveness and address them before they become entrenched .
Finally , euro-area nations must strive harder to find common positions on international issues and to speak with a single voice in the global arena .
This is the only way to promote and defend the EMU 's economic interests in a world where the challenges are global and overcoming them will increasingly depend on multilateral cooperation .
Consider November 's international summit on the financial crisis .
Agreeing a common position ahead of the meeting gave Europe a greater role .
When the euro area manages to agree swiftly on a coordinated position , this can be instrumental to finding agreement in the EU as a whole and internationally .
It is vital we now build on this success and develop a genuine international strategy for the euro .
The European single currency has been a major success , but it remains a work in progress .
A decade after the euro 's introduction , we must follow the example of its founders and turn crisis into opportunity by uniting in a spirit of cooperation and ambition -- and thereby reinforce the EMU 's foundations .
The Euro Catalyst
PARIS -- In 2000 , shortly after the launch of the euro , I wrote a book arguing that countries adopting the common currency should be forced in one way or another to implement structural reforms .
Ten years later , where do we stand ?
Surprisingly , the first country to reform was Germany .
Thanks to an environment favorable to export-oriented firms and , most notably , to wage discipline , Germany began to post significant balance-of-payment surpluses .
This is evident today on a dramatic scale , and is sustaining German economic growth , and one of the lowest unemployment rates in Europe .
The story is markedly different in other eurozone members .
The `` PIIGS '' -LRB- Portugal , Italy , Ireland , Greece , and Spain -RRB- greatly benefited from the euro , thanks not only to the removal of currency-related trade barriers , but also because their interest rates suddenly fell to levels unthinkable in pre-euro times .
Furthermore , because these countries no longer faced current-account constraints , they could spend beyond their means without any immediate apparent damage to their economies .
With this artificial boost to their economic growth , they had little incentive to press ahead with unpopular reforms in line with the European Union 's Lisbon agenda .
Then came the global crisis .
During these hard times -LRB- 2007-2009 -RRB- , the euro 's usefulness and the eurozone 's resilience were welcomed the world over .
Only during the exit from the crisis did problems begin to surface .
The size of public debts , which had been ballooning in many countries during the crisis , together with growing competitiveness gaps between member states , began worrying markets .
Some investors , doubtful of the sustainability of some countries ' public debt , began to worry about the viability of the euro itself .
Reactions to this perilous momentum came without delay .
At the European level , there has been a swift and impressive mobilization of resources .
And EU President Herman van Rompuy is preparing a framework for enhanced fiscal surveillance , prevention , and resolution .
As Jean Monnet , one of the `` founding fathers '' European integration , presciently observed in his memoirs 35 years ago , `` the European construction is moving ahead during crisis , and it will be the sum of the solutions brought about in order to overcome them . ''
No one can deny that structural reforms are currently underway in all eurozone countries that have been struck by the crisis .
Suddenly , reform became une impérieuse obligation , if not -- given the pressure of financial markets -- a matter of outright survival .
Consider Greece , the eurozone member in the most acute predicament .
Reforms of the labor market , the pension system , and those underway or planned in many sectors and professions -- all of which generate huge reserves for enhanced growth and , therefore , hope -- reflect a profound change in the public 's perception of the country 's long-term needs .
Indeed , despite endemic social unrest , a large majority of Greeks acknowledges the need for change and does not oppose it .
Euroskeptics will say that it is not the euro , but the crisis itself , that has catalyzed reform .
To be sure , the euro alone has not been a sufficient trigger .
But , given past European experience , there is serious reason to doubt that , in the absence of the euro , the crisis alone would have provided the necessary impetus .
Before the euro , a country facing a public-finance crisis would have been forced into a predictable , hopeless sequence : devaluation of its currency , followed by inflation , which alleviated the public-debt burden .
It was n't long before it was back to `` business as usual , '' with hardly any structural reform .
How many Greek crises , after all , paved the way to Greece 's current crisis ?
Competitive devaluation , which skeptics are calling for , must be avoided this time around .
Eurozone members facing a loss of competitiveness can no longer afford to skirt difficult but necessary reforms through a monetary `` quick fix '' that shifts the burden onto their trade partners : as always , beggar-thy-neighbor policies reward laxity and penalize virtue .
As for the structural reforms now underway or in the planning stage , the most important question is not whether the euro , the crisis , or a combination of the two brought them about , but whether they will succeed .
Clearly , failure would impose huge political costs that leaders will be impelled to take all necessary steps to avoid .
They already have shown remarkable determination , providing grounds to be optimistic that this time things will , indeed , be different .
A Global Civics Lesson
ISTANBUL -- The reality of the world 's epic interdependence is well known .
We have seen how financial engineering in the United States can determine economic growth in every part of the world ; how carbon-dioxide emissions from China end up influencing crop yields and livelihoods in Vietnam , Bangladesh , the Maldives , and beyond ; how an epidemic in Mexico endangers the rhythm of public life in the US ; or how volcanic ash from Iceland affects travel across Europe .
We are also familiar with the inherent difficulties of devising and implementing solutions to global problems through nation-states , and have relied on two broad models to deal with this predicament .
The first is composed of a wide range of creative ad hoc alliances and solutions .
When standard global public health instruments proved insufficient , for example , we built the Global Fund to Fight Tuberculosis , AIDS , and Malaria .
When the Internet became global , its management was turned over to ICANN , the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers , which enlists the voices of individual Internet users in its governance -- a significant departure from intergovernmental multilateralism .
The US , as the most powerful member of the international system , tends to prefer ad hoc approaches to global governance .
With its vast resources and alliances , ad hoc solutions allow the US to advance its interests effectively without the entanglements of more enduring rules , customs , and structures .
Europeans prefer a more systematic reliance on the rule of law , and also on what has come to be known as the global public-goods paradigm .
Adherents of this view point first and foremost to the existence of certain vital global public goods , climate being the most obvious example .
By definition , public goods mean a collective-action problem .
The global public-goods paradigm also implies some commensurability , if not uniformity , in the way we respond to various global collective-action challenges .
Americans tend to find this expectation of commensurability suffocating , while Europeans find it reassuring and liberating .
-LRB- The developing world has been largely absent in this debate , with notable exceptions in the form of indignation about unfairness built into the status quo , peppered with obstructionism . -RRB-
Like many other cardinal questions , the tension between these approaches is unlikely to be resolved conclusively .
We are more likely to live with this tension for a long time , with emphasis shifting back and forth between approaches .
It would thus be much more worthwhile to focus on a neglected issue : what responsibilities do we all have toward people who happen not to be our compatriots ?
Both the ad hoc and the global public-goods schools shy away from this question , and yet without at least some working answer , we will lack the compass needed to navigate our increasing global interdependence .
We need to recognize that global governance is not a technocratic puzzle to be solved by clever institutional design .
We can not establish an effective social contract without an explicit understanding of our responsibilities towards each other -- and of the rights that emerge alongside those responsibilities .
The answers are to be found not only in the speeches given at the United Nations General Assembly or at the Davos World Economic Forum , but in the conversations we have with our friends , families , and colleagues .
We must all consider what responsibilities we are willingly ready to accept , and then discuss our answers with others .
This will mean starting to imagine -- without panic or rush , and with all the care and thoughtfulness that this conversation requires -- a global civics .
Current and probable future levels of global connectivity and interdependence enable and require us to commence this conversation .
Whether or not we realize it , we have comparable conversations every day .
For example , every day millions of people drive at high speeds encased in a ton of metal , and they do so extremely close to others who are doing the same thing .
A slight move of the steering wheel in the wrong direction would wreak havoc , but we cruise carefree , because we have reasonable expectations about the behavior of other drivers .
Our expectations of other drivers , which serve to mitigate the theoretical risks of driving , can exist because people adhere to a framework of laws , habits , and conventions about how to operate automobiles .
In an increasingly interdependent world , we need a corresponding global framework to put our minds at relative ease .
That framework has to be based on global civics , a system of conscious responsibilities that we are ready to take on -- and corresponding rights that we are ready to claim -- after due deliberation .
To imagine the shape of global civics , a worthwhile exercise would be to take 15 minutes to consider what we would say to the seven billionth human being -- who will join us in less than a thousand days -- about the human condition awaiting her .
This hypothetical conversation would help us take stock of global conditions that we have all helped produce , and would set us on a path toward discovering our core responsibilities to each other and the next generation -- the essence of global civics .
Poverty 's Cancer
GENEVA -- Cancer is an enormous -- and growing -- global public-health problem .
And , of the 7.6 million cancer deaths every year , 4.8 million occur in the developing world .
A disease formerly considered more pervasive in affluent countries now places its heaviest burden on poor and disadvantaged populations .
In some African countries , fewer than 15 % of cancer patients survive for five years following diagnosis of cervical and breast cancer , diseases that are highly curable elsewhere in the world .
These are shocking statistics , with huge implications for human suffering , health-care systems -LRB- and budgets -RRB- , and the international drive to reduce poverty .
The increase in cancer 's impact on the poor reflects factors such as demographic growth , population aging , the spread of unhealthy lifestyles -LRB- including tobacco use -RRB- , and lack of control of cancer-associated infections .
These trends are not easily reversed .
If no action is taken , the number of cancer deaths in the developing world is forecast to grow to 5.9 million in 2015 and 9.1 million in 2030 .
While cancer deaths in wealthy countries are expected to increase less dramatically , they are nonetheless predicted to rise by a harrowing 40 % over the next 20 years .
Throughout the developing world , most health-care systems are designed to cope with episodes of infectious disease .
But most lack the funds , equipment , and qualified personnel needed to provide basic care for cancer patients .
Thirty countries -- half of them in Africa -- do not have a single radiotherapy machine .
And these countries certainly do not have the financial resources , facilities , equipment , technology , infrastructure , staff , or training to cope with the long-term demands of cancer care .
They also have little capacity for prevention , public education , or early diagnosis and treatment , whether it be early detection in primary care , surgery , radiotherapy , or chemotherapy .
In large parts of Africa , such treatments are usually reserved for those rich enough to seek specialized care abroad .
The demands of chronic care for a disease like cancer are simply overwhelming .
Countries and families also pay a huge economic cost , as the lives of millions of people who could otherwise have made productive contributions to their families and communities for many decades are cut short .
The real tragedy , of course , is that many of these patients do not have to die .
We know that around one-third of cancers can be prevented .
This figure could be increased markedly if more emphasis were placed on identifying additional environmental and lifestyle-associated factors that increase cancer risks .
In addition , a diagnosis no longer has to be a death sentence , because one-third of cancers can be cured if detected early and treated properly .
The World Health Organization and the International Atomic Energy Agency are working closely together to improve cancer control in developing countries .
The IAEA 's work involves building countries ' capacity for radiation medicine .
But technology means nothing without well-trained and motivated staff to use it .
That is why both organizations are developing training and mentoring networks and innovative public-private partnerships .
With its broad approach to public health , it is also essential to strengthen health-care systems and primary care in order to improve early detection , timely diagnosis and treatment , as well as palliative care .
Preventive measures such as public-health initiatives to curb smoking can be remarkably effective .
Vaccines against hepatitis B and human papillomaviruses , if made available at affordable prices , could contribute significantly to the prevention of liver and cervical cancers , respectively .
At the International Agency for Research on Cancer , the specialized cancer agency of WHO , further research on the causes of cancer is being conducted , which promises to provide the base of evidence required to alleviate even more of the worldwide cancer burden , .
We are seeing promising results in individual countries , but our efforts are just a drop in a vast ocean of need .
In order to respond to the growing cancer epidemic , we need nothing less than concerted global action similar to the successful mobilization against HIV\/AIDS .
Cancer should be acknowledged as a vital part of the global health agenda .
World leaders should be made aware of the scale of the cancer crisis facing developing countries .
We need systematic action at the highest level to end the deadly disparity in cancer survival rates between rich and poor countries , thereby helping to save millions of lives .
The goal must be to promote effective cancer control that is integrated into national health-care systems throughout the developing world .
The United Nations General Assembly 's Summit on Non-Communicable Diseases in September provides an opportunity to focus the world 's attention on cancer in developing countries .
Let us make cancer control one of the good news stories of 2011 .
Europe and President Bush
Europe and President Bush
ROME : What does the future hold for transatlantic relations ?
That question arises with every new American administration .
Because worries about a `` widening Atlantic '' gap have existed since the early 1970s , it is tempting to proceed as if transatlantic relations will remain on roughly the same wavelength as before .
The truth is , however , that the US and the EU are rapidly evolving along their own paths : both sides of the Atlantic thus face the challenge of managing an ever more complex relationship .
Two other temptations must also be resisted .
On the European side is the temptation to speed the emergence of the Union as an international actor by constantly claiming autonomy or independence from the US .
Lingering anti-American undertones , of course , will invariably surface for , as in any long unbalanced relationship , the junior partner will tend to make declaratory statements that generate misperceptions .
Europeans should not succumb to this temptation , for the move from dependency to equal partnership is not measured by rhetoric .
Instead , Europeans must assume a fairer share of the transatlantic burden , putting in place a truly common European foreign policy , and think and act as a regional power with a global outreach .
If the Euro succeeds as a global currency , which I believe it will , and if Europe 's rapid reaction force becomes a reality soon , as I also think it will , the EU will have secured the preconditions for a more equal partnership -- literally by putting its money -LRB- and soldiers -RRB- where its mouth is .
On the American side , the temptation is to overplay its `` sole superpower '' role by acting unilaterally .
But this is loneliness disguised as leadership and is not in America 's interest .
National interests can no longer be effectively pursued unilaterally ; US global interests are served best by multilateral action and bodies .
Even if , in military terms , America remains the sole superpower , military might is of limited use in the daily conduct of foreign policy .
America would benefit not less than Europe from an effective system of global governance in the achievement of its goals -- be it freer trade , a viable non-proliferation regime , containment and prevention of regional conflicts , or better regulated financial markets .
To this end , the US has a vital stake in the EU 's coming of age as an international actor .
It should therefore do away with the traditional ambivalence of demanding a more mature and active Europe on one hand , all the time feeling uncomfortable with it on the other .
True , America officially welcomed the launching of a common European security and defense policy .
But recurring signs of US nervousness about the nature of this process exist .
Americans often ask whether it is all about better European capabilities -- which would be fine for NATO -- or about European integration -LRB- i.e. instrumental to a political project -RRB- .
My response is that it is about both , and that Washington should support both .
A sober assessment of this process leads me to assert that a more capable and united Europe will usher in a more effective Atlantic Alliance and not , as some believe , in American disengagement from European commitments .
What the EU aims at is not a duplication of NATO structures or an alternative to the Atlantic Alliance .
The EU is preparing to deal -- jointly with US forces or with purely European forces when NATO as a whole decides not to engage -- with crises in and around Europe .
More than defense -- which will remain NATO-centered -- Europe is building up its security role as a regional stabilizer : a role that EU enlargement to include candidate countries in Central and Eastern Europe will strengthen .
For , contrary to what is often said in America 's Congress , Europe already bears the lion 's share of the peacekeeping burden -LRB- let alone reconstruction aid -RRB- in the Balkans .
It goes without saying that there should be `` no taxation without representation . ''
Washington , however , should not worry about this : if Europeans see the Alliance as a more European organization they are more likely to commit themselves -LRB- in budgetary terms , too -RRB- to its success .
A similar logic of partnership applies to enlargement .
The concept of Europe is not immutable , and rightly so .
On the basis of a broad notion of security and stability , EU enlargement is every bit as important as deepening the EU .
Here a common transatlantic approach to both EU and NATO enlargement would enhance stabilization and integration in post-Cold War Europe -- to everyone 's benefit .
A new and functional division of labor between Europeans and Americans is thus conceivable , provided it retains the framework of common political commitments and shared responsibilities .
What should not be pursued is a rigid , vertical and artificial division of labor , whereby the US plays the lone global leader -LRB- with Europe simply following -RRB- while the EU concentrates exclusively on enlarging its `` house '' -LRB- with the US disengaging from Continental security -RRB- .
This would be unhealthy and make the transatlantic compound unsustainable .
The antidote is a genuine sharing of choices and decisions .
If divisive decisions must be taken , healthy partnership requires that they be discussed openly and honestly .
A case in point is the issue of National Missile Defense .
No matter what policy the Bush administration adopts , European reservations and doubts should be taken into account .
If Europeans want to have some influence here , they must play a unitary role by , say , encouraging America to update the ABM Treaty in agreement with Moscow .
That would help strategic stability , prevent antagonizing Russia -LRB- which remains a fundamental factor in European security -RRB- and avoid deteriorating the security climate in Asia .
The same is true of dealing with so-called `` rogue States '' : here again , a better combination of US and European strategies could produce a more effective approach , based on a blend of engagement and resolve .
A new division of labor , and a new sharing of responsibilities , depends as much on economics as on security .
A stable Euro makes stronger cooperation possible and desirable : not only to prevent global financial instability but to avoid the risk of conflicting currency blocs arising .
Provided that the Bush Administration pragmatically pushes for more trade liberalization , we will be able to deepen transatlantic market integration , which will act as a boost for our economies .
Scope will also then exist for revitalizing the WTO , for which a strong European-American commitment is a necessary precondition , though not the entire solution .
Here a serious reassessment of our negotiating tactics and old habits is needed .
The WTO , but also the IMF and World Bank , must understand the evolving needs of those societies most vulnerable to the impact of globalization .
We need to reach out to the rest of the world in a more open and persuasive way .
The G-8 process , which Italy chairs this year , will test such resolve - on which rests the legitimacy of the entire process .
A renewed Euro-American partnership based on our own respective styles and instruments in foreign policy will benefit both sides .
The EU is rightly searching for its identity as a collective actor .
As Europe changes , so too does America -- in terms of its demographic and social composition , economic and political structures , geopolitical orientation and national psychology .
Granted , transatlantic diversity might cause occasional squabbles .
However , mutual interaction and equal partnership remain the only response -- especially if they are reflected into long overdue reforms of multilateral institutions and increased global governance .
Operating within multilateral frameworks , however tiresome , has more often than not served US national interests as well as those of Europe .
This will not change .
A stronger EU is America 's natural partner , occasional competitor , but certainly not a rival .
It is the duty of governments on both sides of the Atlantic to persuade their publics of this .
Europe by Degrees ROME &#45; &#45; A year ago , few people would have bet that the European Union , still reeling from the trauma of the Constitutional Treaty 's rejection in 2005 , would be poised to ratify the new Reform Treaty , adopted in Lisbon last December .
For some , the fact that the United Kingdom might ratify it even earlier than traditionally `` pro-European '' countries like Italy merely underscores the Treaty 's lack of new and bold initiatives to accelerate European unification .
But they are wrong .
To be sure , impatient dissatisfaction has been a driving force behind European integration since its initial years .
But , as Robert Schuman wrote in his Declaration in 1950 , Europe could not be built all at once .
Likewise , Altiero Spinelli , another of the EU 's founding fathers , wrote late in life that without visionary Europeans there would be no Europe , but without pragmatic statesmen , the visionaries would have gotten nowhere .
The Reform Treaty 's shortcomings are obvious .
Abandoning the name `` Constitution '' was probably necessary to bring all member states on board .
But not equally necessary is the enduring uncertainty about the common political platform upon which Europe 's voice in foreign policy will have to rely .
Moreover , the Area of Freedom , Security , and Justice still requires unanimity for essential decisions in the fight against crime and terrorism and therefore , implying excruciating slowness .
Nor does the Treaty do enough to strengthen coordination of Europe 's economic and budgetary policies .
Moreover , agencies such as Europol and Eurojust will be similarly subject to greater parliamentary scrutiny , and the budgetary procedure will be simpler and more democratic .
The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights will become legally binding and the judicial protection of citizens will be enhanced by facilitating their access to the European Court of Justice and by extending the Court 's jurisdiction .
The Union 's capacity as a global actor will be enhanced by merging the High Representative with the Commissioner for External Relations and establishing a single diplomatic service .
The list could continue , but we already have reason enough to conclude that getting the best out of the new Treaty will be the best that the EU and its member states can do .
The first ingredients of a common collective identity have been injected into the EU 's enlarged membership , which is still marked by diverse positions , sensitivities , and expectations .
Asking everyone to do more than what everyone is unanimously ratifying would undermine Europe 's fragile harmony .
Nothing , however , prevents smaller groups of member states from aiming at bolder goals through separate agreements , if their mutual trust and similarities encourage them to do it .
After all , this was how the Schengen Treaty -- which later became part of the acquis communitaire -LRB- the body of EU law -RRB- -- came into being .
More recently , the Prun agreement has elevated police cooperation to police integration among the participating states .
There is reason to hope that some of the EU 's member states will embark on this venture in fighting crime and terrorism , defense matters , or in financial and budgetary harmonization .
Fifty years later , this is the lesson for us of the Schuman 's declaration .
Europe 's Constitutional Future
Europe 's Constitutional Future
Last week , the President of the European Convention , Valery Giscard d'Estaing , submitted a so-called `` skeleton '' for a future Constitution of Europe .
All the ingredients of a constitution - values , principles , the rights of citizens , the competencies of the Union and its constituent institutions , etc - were included .
This document arose despite the fact that the Convention 's mandate did not empower the delegates to produce a constitution .
According to the Nice Declaration , which I drafted as one of the participating prime ministers , we were only to simplify and restructure the EU 's basic treaties .
As the C onvention worked , our mandate was transformed due to various pressures .
These came from member countries , from civil society organizations , and from letters , documents , and email messages from across Europe .
Democratic pressure changed our mandate .
When even the Foreign Minister of Britain , a country happy with its centuries-old `` unwritten constitution , '' claims himself eager to have a written European Constitution , something truly has changed !
Yet , scholars such as Ralph Dahrendorf and Joseph Weiler suggest that a European constitution does not make sense because a democratic constitution presupposes a paramount common identity that is absent in an EU where individual national loyalties still prevail .
Others , such as Robert Dahl , argue that democracy requires smaller communities based on shared interests and personal relations .
For them , Europe may be too big to forge truly democratic institutions .
Such theoretical objections must be set against the fact Europe already exists - indeed , decisions are made everyday on the European level which determine our lives .
We may dislike it , but the EU is part of our system of government , like municipalities , regions , and nation-states .
So the question is not whether Europe exists , but whether we are satisfied with the way it functions .
If not , can we fix it , and is a constitution the way to do it ?
The first problem in need of a `` constitutional '' solution that is tackled is Europe 's clear and unified identity .
Not many people realize it , but because of the patchwork of treaties from which today 's European institutions arose , `` Europe '' is not a unitary entity ; indeed , the `` European Union '' and the `` European Community '' denote two different things .
The Community is the set of institutions created in the 1950 's to establish a common market .
When we decided later to have a common foreign policy , and to cooperate in judicial and police matters , we invented the Union .
The Union deals with foreign policy ; the Community with economic integration .
One consequence of this is that agreements with third countries that involve both foreign and economic matters require two distinct treaties : one for the Union , one for the Community .
This confuses even trained foreign diplomats who negotiate with Europe .
If it confuses them , how befuddling must it be for ordinary citizens ?
How can a European citizen really identify with Europe if no single `` Europe '' exists ?
Europe 's indistinct legal identity has another deleterious impact .
If the Community does something that affects someone 's rights , he or she can go to court .
But if the Union encroaches on your rights , access to a court may be closed because the Union happens to have no legal personality !
The next problem to be tackled - again with constitutional implications - is the anonymous , bureaucratic nature of European legal acts .
Criticizing institutions is as essential a part of democracy as protecting enumerated legal rights .
But Europe 's institutions are hard to criticize because they produce acts that ordinary people can not name or understand .
In national life , acts of parliaments are called `` statutes '' or `` laws , '' and these usually have names that you can rally for and against .
In the EU we have '' regulations , '' `` directives , '' `` decisions , '' `` general guidelines , '' `` common strategies , '' `` common actions , '' `` common positions '' - a myriad that only experts can comprehend .
In Italy there is now a controversial statute that will change the rules of criminal procedure in ways that might prove helpful to eminent public figures .
Well , the name of Senator Cirami is attached to that bill .
By god , we can fight about `` the law Cirami '' !
Would things be the same if the bill were called `` Regulation 75 '' ?
Because Europe has so many bodies that legislate - the Council of Ministers , the Council for Agriculture , the Council for Industry , the Council for the Environment , etc. - we can not know who is doing what and why .
We need a single legislative council , a bicameral European Parliament , with one house representing member states , and the other the European electorate .
In this simplified system , legislation will be called legislation , and executive regulations , as in most legal systems , will fill in the gaps in primary legislation .
This is a system European citizens will understand .
The draft constitutional document presented last week introduces small but significant changes that may empower Europe 's citizens to both identify with and criticize Europe .
It calls for a single , unified legal entity .
Whether it is called European Union , United States of Europe , United Europe , or something else , it will also provide for a unitary , simplified system of normative acts that will introduce more transparency and accountability .
The institutional structure envisaged by the proposed European Constitution should also reflect and help develop Europe 's broader aspirations .
Europe must be more than a vehicle of economic integration , which is almost accomplished anyway .
At the simplest , we expect Europe to be fair .
We expect our social model to be realized .
We expect economic and social matters to be connected .
We expect Europe to play a role for good in the world .
Of course , roadblocks await .
One of them is that more Europe can not mean a centralized system .
Democratic governments are too complicated for that .
Getting the proper balance among European , national , regional , and local institutions will be a crucial challenge .
But if the people are to ordain a Constitution for Europe , all of their ties and values will need to be respected by that Constitution .
Europe 's Crisis of Leadership
Europe 's Crisis of Leadership BRUSSELS -- The global financial crisis has already highlighted both the strengths and the weaknesses of the European Union .
Had it not been for the euro , the shock waves from the meltdown of September and October would have spread to the currency markets , creating tensions that would have set Europe 's political and economic integration back by decades , perhaps imperiling the whole project .
Much less positively , EU member states have been slow to act in concert .
At first it was the European Commission that drew criticism for its slowness in making proposals to rally national governments and their policymakers .
Now it is the member states that are resisting the urgent need for a coordinated EU-wide policy response to the deepening crisis .
The speed and the severity of the economic slowdown are far greater than any of the post-war downturns of the past 60 years .
In Europe , we by and large failed to heed the warning signals of America 's sub-prime mortgage crisis when it erupted in the late summer of 2007 , and thus were unprepared when the next phase of the crisis engulfed European banks , too .
The lesson to be drawn is that the EU must move more quickly and with greater determination than has been the case so far .
Throughout the EU , people are asking , `` What is Europe doing to address the crisis ? ''
The answer is `` not nearly enough , '' and the political price may be high at next summer 's European Parliament elections .
The remaining weeks of 2008 will be crucial to Europe 's efforts to regain the initiative and to attempt to attenuate the effects of the crisis while also addressing unresolved problems on the EU reform agenda .
As Trustees of Friends of Europe , we would urge the European institutions and EU political leaders to renew their efforts regarding both the Lisbon Treaty and the Lisbon Agenda .
France 's EU Presidency has done much to improve coordination between member states ' responses to the financial crisis , and the European Commission has also begun to play the more active role that Friends of Europe called for on October 10 .
The challenge now is for the presidency and the Commission to give fresh political impetus to the EU 's stalled reform drive .
The December 11-12 European Council should signal clearly the timetable envisaged for re-opening the Lisbon Treaty 's ratification process . Failure to do so would bring the risk of still greater political problems after next June 's European elections .
The Lisbon Treaty is a step towards adapting the EU 's decision-making mechanisms to the twenty-first century and a membership of 27 or more countries .
The global nature of the current crisis makes it plain that Europe must be able to decide quickly and coherently , or suffer adverse consequences .
There seems little doubt that public opinion across the EU is increasingly drawing the same conclusions .
The sovereign right of the Irish people to decide their own future is unchallengeable .
But Ireland should also allow the EU 's other member states to proceed with the Lisbon Treaty if that is what they wish .
Even if another referendum is to be held in Ireland , the Irish government should foresee a procedure that , irrespective of the outcome , allows other member states to implement the essential parts of the Lisbon treaty .
The Commission now needs to take action to ensure that member states redouble their efforts with regard to the Lisbon Agenda for overhauling Europe 's global competitiveness .
In 2000 , the EU set a ten-year program of agreed reform targets , yet in many cases its member states have lacked the political will to implement them .
Europe 's increasingly gloomy prospects make these reforms more necessary than ever .
Now For An Arab Economic Revolution
BEIRUT -- Revolution across the Arab world has forced the region 's peoples and governments to grapple with the need for change .
Years of sclerosis have given way to a frantic push for reforms to match the aspirations and discontent of millions .
But reform momentum is tugging in two , quite opposite , directions .
One push is for governments to provide for their people ; the other calls for governments to stop restricting their people 's freedom , particularly their economic liberty . The first type of reform will likely only exacerbate the Arab world 's grave problems ; the second offers hope for positive and sustainable change .
In several Arab countries , most notably Saudi Arabia , rulers have sought to quell popular discontent by providing a combination of cash , subsidies , guaranteed jobs , and free goods and services .
Such largesse betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of the causes of today 's discontent , because it assumes that these causes are purely material .
But any examination of the protesters ' slogans and demands clearly indicates otherwise .
The protests are much more about political and economic freedom than about material needs , reflecting a keen awareness that such needs are merely a symptom and consequence of the absence of political and economic freedom .
The dominant `` handout approach '' is not sustainable , and , if continued , would likely exacerbate the Arab world 's current economic malaise .
Economic wealth can not be created by government decree ; it comes from productive jobs that create goods and services that people value .
Governments that hand out benefits are not making their citizens richer by generating new wealth ; they are simply redistributing existing wealth . This also applies to government-created and guaranteed jobs : if a job is indeed productive , its output would be rewarded by other members of society who benefit from it , without the need for government subsidies and guarantees .
The fact that government guarantees a job implies that its output is not wanted .
Such jobs are a liability for society , not an asset .
As citizens start relying on redistribution , productive work is discouraged , and real wealth creation suffers .
Economic rot sets in as the ranks of dependent citizens grow , productive citizens dwindle in number , and society eventually runs out of other people 's money .
But the popularity of the handout option raises an important and instructive question : just how did the ruling classes in these countries amass fortunes so large that people are clamoring for them to be redistributed ?
Government officials and their cronies did not necessarily engage in straightforward theft or pillaging .
Through innocuous-sounding government `` supervision '' and `` regulation '' -- and under the guidance of the major international financial institutions -- ruling elites managed to run entire sectors of the economy as personal fiefdoms .
While this pattern of official behavior is reprehensible , the real disaster is that it destroyed Arabs ' economic productivity and initiative .
This economic totalitarianism has been legitimated by government charity .
Arab elites have been engaged in a false embrace of economic reforms for decades , with countless ministerial shuffles , five-year plans , and elaborate World Bank and International Monetary Fund programs .
But all these reforms involve government handouts or government-created jobs and opportunities ; rarely do they involve removing the government 's grip over people 's lives .
By framing the debate on reform as being about the type of handouts , governments evade tackling the real problem : their control of economic activity .
State handouts can be reliably financed only by controlling the economy 's productive sectors . But in the Arab world , as everywhere else , this leads to theft , corruption , uncompetitive monopolies , a stifling of enterprise , and , eventually and inevitably , to decline and decay .
The toppled Tunisian and Egyptian regimes spent decades providing handouts while denying citizens economic freedom .
As Arabs confront far-reaching change , they must not be distracted into fruitless debates about the right types of government support for citizens .
What is needed is a root and branch transformation of the way that economic activity is carried out in all Arab nations .
Arab countries need to become places where people can create their own productive jobs , pursue their own opportunities , provide for themselves , and determine their own future .
This freedom obviates the need for the charity of those in power , and more importantly , takes away from them the excuse for maintaining their iron grip over the economic lives of their citizens .
Mubarak 's Odious Debts
NEW YORK -- A glance at Egypt 's public finances reveals a disturbing fact : the interest that the country pays on its foreign loans is larger than its budget for education , healthcare , and housing combined .
Indeed , these debt-service costs alone account for 22 % of the Egyptian government 's total expenditures .
The impact has become impossible to ignore .
With growing political uncertainty and a slowing economy , Egypt is likely to witness decreasing government revenues , increasing demands for urgent spending , and rising interest rates on government borrowing .
This could lead to a fiscal catastrophe for the government at the very moment when the country is attempting a complicated political transition .
Egypt 's public debt is around 80 % of GDP , very close to the 90 % level that economists Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart identify as a harbinger of slower growth and heightened vulnerability to financial and fiscal crises .
Egyptians need only glance north , at the European debt crisis , to understand they should sort out their debt problem now , rather than waiting until it reaches Greek proportions .
This debt was incurred during the 30-year reign of the deposed president , Hosni Mubarak .
In international law , debt that is incurred without the consent of the people , and that is not used to their benefit , is referred to as `` odious '' ; as such , it is not considered transferable to successor regimes .
The reasoning is simple and logical : if someone fraudulently borrows money in my name , I am not expected to pay it back , and neither should a country 's population when an unrepresentative leader borrows in their name and to their detriment .
For three decades , Mubarak 's borrowing only enriched him and his ruling clique while impoverishing and repressing the rest of Egypt .
Corruption was rife , but not just the covert type : public money was openly used to support many businesses under flimsy pretexts like `` fostering economic growth '' and `` creating employment . ''
Along with regulatory capture , this harmed competitiveness , market openness , and Egypt 's small and medium-size businesses .
The beneficiaries of this largesse are now mostly sitting in prison awaiting trial .
The rest of Egypt , however , only felt this money in the form of an ever-expanding state apparatus that solidified Mubarak 's rule , crushed dissent , and repressed millions .
When Egyptians rose up against Mubarak in January , they were confronted by weapons paid for with borrowed money .
Is it fair to expect Egyptians to continue paying for their previous repression and impoverishment at the hands of Mubarak and his cronies ?
Since this money clearly benefited Mubarak but not his people , should it not be Mubarak , rather than his victims , who is held responsible for it ?
The type of regime Mubarak was running had been clear for many years , and it was also clear how the money was being used .
A prudent lender should have considered these facts before making the loans .
So the banks and international institutions that lent money to Mubarak should bear the responsibility of their choice to bankroll his repressive regime .
The new Egypt should make a clean break with Mubarak and his creditors , and let them sort out their business among themselves without involving the Egyptian people .
The Egyptian government 's only role should be to help liquidate Mubarak assets for repayment should the need arise .
This would be not only fair , but it also would teach an important lesson to those who bankroll dictators -- a lesson that is likely to have an immediate positive impact worldwide .
Lenders to a repressive regime will no longer expect these debts to be repaid by its successors , immediately making lenders worldwide careful about lending to them .
An Egyptian precedent would bring awareness and sobriety to an entire generation of lenders that is not accustomed to considering this type of risk , and that may even be unfamiliar with the doctrine of odious debt .
Transferring liability for foreign debt to Mubarak should not have negative economic consequences for Egypt in the long run .
This move should not be understood as a move towards fiscal recklessness , but as a one-time break from it .
With a smaller debt burden and interest payments , Egypt 's fiscal position would improve significantly , and threats to economic growth would recede .
Foreign lenders ' resulting caution would prevent future Egyptian governments from irresponsibly saddling their populace with debt .
Perhaps most importantly , the days of borrowing to build a large state security apparatus would be gone for good -- worldwide .
For the sake of Egyptians and people living under tyranny everywhere , Egypt 's government must take a brave stand .
The Gazpromization of European Energy Security
Concerns in the EU over energy security , fueled by increasing dependence on Russia , have never been greater . Together with the Russian authorities ' expropriation of oil company Yukos , foreigners have been squeezed out of Russia 's energy extraction sector .
Inevitably , many in Europe are questioning the value of the Kremlin 's word .
Rather than turning away , the EU should seek deeper engagement and reciprocity .
It should facilitate further incorporation of Gazprom into the EU market through market liberalization and downstream integration .
Yet it must also press for Gazprom 's ultimate restructuring and real market entry into Russia for European companies , because Russia 's unwillingness to do so guarantees energy insecurity for Europe .
Indeed , the Putin administration established a track record of bending rules and bullying foreign investors , with the support of prosecutors , tax authorities , regulatory agencies , and courts .
At the same time , Gazprom has evolved into the dominant market-maker in gas for Europe , and its actions have made a mockery of EU efforts at greater collaboration with Russia .
Gazprom strategy deploys three tactics : co-optation -- cultivating partnerships with certain countries , political leaders , and corporations , as levers of its interests ; preemption -- using upstream power and Russian diplomacy to manipulate downstream conditions and scoop up assets ; and disaggregation -- dividing the EU through bilateral deals .
Gazprom 's co-optation of Europe has been achieved mainly through Germany , where its partnerships with energy companies and banks have helped align the authorities with Russian aims .
Extensive lobbying , directly and by proxy , is underway to persuade European regulators to allow long-term supply contracts in the EU -- despite their deadening effect on competition .
Preemption by Gazprom has been accomplished through a raft of acquisitions .
Gazprom has flooded the market in Turkey , withheld gas in Ukraine , threatened to do so in Belarus , and offered preferential market access to willing partners , such as Italy .
In the Caucasus , the Kremlin has prevented Iran from establishing infrastructure to compete as a supplier of gas to Europe .
To stop Iran 's gas , Russia effectively bought Armenia 's entire energy sector , while its support for Iran 's nuclear program helps maintain Iranian isolation , keeping away the Western money Iran would need to become a rival gas exporter .
Gazprom 's dominance is reinforced by activities coordinated with the Kremlin to assert its influence in markets like Spain and Italy .
In exchange for gas deals with rival suppliers , such as Algeria , Russia has offered vast concessions on arms and preferential debt terms .
In other cases , the Kremlin acts punitively , as when it cut off oil supplies to Lithuania following the sale of the Mazeikiu Nafta refinery to a Polish company , or to Ukraine after its people voted for the `` wrong '' party .
The prime example of disaggregation is the Nord Stream pipeline , which appeals to Germany while angering Poland and the Baltic countries .
The undersea pipeline will cost three times as much as a new pipeline along existing land routes , undermines the energy security of Germany 's eastern neighbors , and threatens the Baltic Sea 's fragile ecosystem .
But , by delivering exports directly to Germany , Russia will be able to cut off gas to Ukraine , Poland , and the Baltic states without directly affecting West European supplies -- and Russia 's recent behavior indicates that this is a real threat .
But Gazprom is worried about its upstream capabilities , as is evident from the decision to divert gas from its Shtokman field to Europe rather than liquify it for new North American markets .
As long as Gazprom remains opaque , Europe can not know whether its key supplier is spending enough to develop future reserves .
The Kremlin 's political battle to win control of Russia 's energy sector has resulted in a dramatic reduction in the growth rate of domestic oil and gas production .
That is a problem for Europe .
Gazprom can not be a partner to Europe if it does not invest in its own infrastructure , yet plays a leading role in stripping Russian private businesses , invests $ 14 billion in non-core assets , such as news media , and is run from the Office of the Presidential Administration .
The lights must not go out across Europe .
Brussels must demand transparency , symmetry , and the rule of law from Moscow , with the goal being a revolutionary integration of European and Russian energy markets .
Simultaneously , through the diversification of supply sources , massive investments in liquified natural gas -LRB- LNG -RRB- , and a strong push in favor of the Nabucco pipeline and inter-connectors between the Mediterranean rim countries , Europe can move closer toward energy security .
The very downstream access Gazprom wants in Europe is the EU 's trump card .
The EU should tell Gazprom that access to Europe 's downstream assets is conditional on the reciprocal openness of Russia 's energy sector .
The result would be a welcome place in the European energy market for a Russia that is both trusted and respected by its international partners .
Europe 's Military Revolution
Europe 's Military Revolution
BRUSSELS : Creating the euro -- a revolutionary innovation in an EU whose nature is to evolve slowly , by fits and starts -- provoked debate across the continent and beyond .
No longer . Americans increasingly ask : `` Why bother ? '' and point to the efficacy of NATO .
Europeans often find such questions hard to answer , partly because there is no single answer .
For believers in a more united Europe , closer cooperation on defense is self-evidently desirable .
Others emphasize the pragmatic , pointing out that EU members can achieve far more in foreign\/defense policy by working together than on their own .
These pragmatists stress the growing number of external challenges -- in the Balkans , Middle East , Africa or elsewhere -- requiring a concerted response .
A third argument , held by some French Gaullists and many EU left-wingers , says that Europe needs a common foreign and defense policy to resist American hegemony .
Supporters of a common EU foreign\/defense policy see a Europe capable of looking after its own defense as a better partner for the US .
Confusion and doubts arise now because of vagueness about the likely uses of the Rapid Reaction Force , a key step in developing these common policies .
The Rapid Reaction Force , it is said , should be capable of fulfilling the so-called `` Petersberg '' tasks .
Because all EU governments know that , for the foreseeable future , Europe will be capable of only modest military operations there is no great value in defining now how the Rapid Reaction Force will be used .
America should welcome the increasing weight and sense of responsibility for Europe as represented by the Rapid Reaction Force .
True , America 's role in NATO -- that ingenious device through which America retains , with Europe 's blessing , an institutionalized influence over the continent -- would diminish .
For NATO would become a framework in which two major powers , instead of one big and 18 smaller ones , coordinate policies and responses to crises .
The gains here outweigh any inconvenience to America 's freedom to maneuver .
Enhanced European capabilities would allow America to leave many instabilities in and around Europe in the care of its allies .
Moreover , adding defense to the informal acquis that would-be EU members must endorse will reduce pressure on NATO to enlarge .
An EU committed to its own defense , although not offering the same formal guarantees as NATO , offers candidate countries the prospect of belonging to a genuine security community .
More fundamentally , creation of a Europe whole and free , but also united , is America 's greatest foreign policy success of the past half-century .
To complete that objective , the EU must become a fully-fledged international actor .
Thus the challenges posed to America by Europe 's common and defense policy are primarily psychological .
In Europe , however , those challenges are matters of will and political leadership , which can not come from committees .
Here we propose a number of institutional and policy reforms , including :
· Merging the jobs of Chris Patten , the external relations commissioner , and Javier Solana , the High Representative for foreign policy , so that the EU speaks with a single voice ;
· Giving the new Brussels based Political and Security Committee higher status to draw together both the inter governmental and Community sides of foreign policy ;
· Setting a Europe wide target for national defense budgets , committing all member states to spending at least 2 % of GDP on defense , and 25 % of their defense budgets on arms procurement and R&D ;
· Creating a special EU defense budget , to finance common missions , capabilities and weapons programs ;
· Establishing a Monitoring Group of force planners , based within the Council of Ministers secretariat , to co ordinate the peer group pressure that should encourage governments to improve their military capabilities .
Authority to build coalitions , push governments to fulfill deadlines , generate support or take the blame for failure must come from that traditional source of leadership , the nation state .
Because no single EU state can provide the dominant leadership America provided NATO during the Cold War , Britain , France , and Germany must assume this role in Europe .
Were one of them to oppose common action , the cohesion and credibility of any EU undertaking would be destroyed .
But if these three are determined to push ahead , they will represent the will of most , if not all , other EU members .
Membership in this group of three entails , not the power to command , but the responsibility to lead .
If these three fail to agree in a crisis , Europe will be opting out ; if united on taking action , Europe will be committed .
So Britain , France , and Germany must start thinking of the EU as a whole , carrying the greatest burden and taking the greatest risks .
Unfortunately , at this moment , none is prepared for these unenviable , yet inevitable , tasks .
But their commitment to Europe 's military revolution is bound to move them closer to fulfilling them .
Europe 's Financial Vulnerability
Europe 's Financial Vulnerability VIENNA -- The most notable innovations of the past two decades have been financial .
Like technological innovation , financial innovation is concerned with the perpetual search for greater efficiency -- in this case , reducing the cost of transferring funds from savers to investors .
Cost reductions that represent a net benefit to society should be regarded favorably .
But as the current financial crisis demonstrates , where financial innovation is designed to circumvent regulation or taxation , we need to be more circumspect .
Sadly , the financial revolution has been mostly rent-seeking rather than welfare-enhancing in character .
It has been based on eliminating , or at least reducing , two key elements of banking costs closely associated with prudential arrangements .
One is the need for banks and other financial institutions to hold liquid reserves .
The less liquid a bank 's assets , the greater the need for such reserves .
But the yield on such reserves is small , so economizing on them is profitable .
Last year 's Northern Rock debacle in the United Kingdom will long remain an example of how not to manage such risk .
Moreover , increasing a bank 's leverage can be very profitable when returns on investments exceed the cost of funding .
Reckless balance-sheet expansion in pursuit of profit is kept in check if financial companies adhere to statutory capital requirements , which mandate a capital-asset ratio of about 8 % .
But many have sought to ignore this restriction , to their cost : the Carlyle Capital Corporation , a subsidiary of the United States-based Carlyle Group , was leveraged up to 32 times -- it held one dollar of capital for every 32 dollars of assets -- before adverse market developments wiped out the company .
Avoidance of prudential requirements is at the core of today 's financial crisis , exacerbated by the collapse of confidence in a system based on trust .
This has exposed the fragility of the banking system , including quasi-banking institutions , as revealed by Bears Sterns , Lehman Brothers , and other US investment banks , and in Europe by Northern Rock , UBS , WestLB , and many more .
Perhaps the most tragic aspect of this story is the exploitation of low-income families involved in the so-called sub-prime mortgage crisis , whereby variable-rate mortgages were offered to customers with a low credit rating .
In fact , `` variable rate '' is a misnomer , since these mortgages ' artificially low initial interest rates were pre-programmed to include a big rate hike after a couple of years .
Thereafter , rates would rise with market rates , but never fall when market rates declined .
This structure could only have been devised to suck in as many customers as possible with scant regard for long-term consequences .
With the property market booming , prospective capital gains promised untold wealth .
And most mortgage holders probably expected to refinance their mortgages before their rising interest-rate trebled or quadrupled monthly repayments .
Another hoped-for benefit was that capital gains could be converted into home equity loans , boosting homeowners ' living standards .
The rude awakening came when property values began to decline .
For those without an equity cushion , refinancing was not a possibility , and rising interest rates have led to default , foreclosure , and homelessness .
Now we hear that sub-prime mortgage holders have only themselves to blame .
No one talks of the bank manager , under pressure to sell `` financial products '' and eager to sign up customers , even if the products were not in a customer 's best interest .
The banker did not question a bonus system that favors one year of super profits , followed by bankruptcy , over two years of moderate , but stable , results .
It is astonishing that sub-prime mortgages and their like were repackaged and resold in securitized form .
That these collateralized mortgage obligations -LRB- CMOs , or bonds backed by a pool of mortgages -RRB- found a ready market , both in the US and abroad , reflects failure on several fronts .
The nature of these CMOs should have been apparent to risk managers .
Any fund manager who claims to have been deluded by the apparently favorable risk-yield characteristics of CMOs or related credit instruments can be accused of having fallen for Milton Friedman 's `` free lunch . ''
Risk models do not justify abandoning one 's natural sense of incredulity .
In a world where capital is free to flow across international boundaries , the crisis in the US has spread to Europe .
This is a new form of contagion , which transcends national boundaries and is amplified by an international crisis of confidence .
This is why the global problem today is many times greater than the Savings & Loan crisis of the 1980 's and 1990 's , which cost American taxpayers an estimated $ 150 billion to clean up .
Today , the global integration of financial markets means that problems can pop up anywhere , at any time .
Central banks are currently attempting to plug one leak as the next appears .
But if the financial system 's dykes collapse , we may be headed for a decade of severe deflation , rendering expansionary stimulus useless .
When the US Federal Reserve was created in 1913 , its most important function was to serve as a lender of last resort to troubled banks , providing emergency liquidity via the discount facility .
The current crisis suggests that this is no longer enough .
Central banks worldwide are being forced to act as market makers of last resort in securities markets .
The signs are already visible .
The European Central Bank has also failed to tackle local bubbles in Europe .
The justification was that the ECB is concerned with inflation , not relative price adjustments .
This means that monetary policy is geared towards the needs of large countries , like Germany , not to those of , say , Belgium .
But , given the scale of the threat to Europe 's economy from a full-blown financial crisis , this apologia for inactivity has outlived its usefulness .
Made in China Remade
SHANGHAI -- `` It 's a dying business , '' said the owner of a garment factory I met in Zhuhai , a city in Guangdong province .
Lured by abundant cheap labor , investors flooded to Zhuhai two decades ago .
Gone , it seems , is the heyday of T-shirts , toys , plastic flowers , tiles , hooks , springs , and the like .
Today , the costs of manufacturing such items are lower in countries like Bangladesh and Vietnam than in Guangdong .
As labor costs continue to climb , is China set to lose its coveted spot as the world 's workshop ?
Rising labor costs are inevitable .
China 's government introduced tough labor laws and a minimum wage in 2008 .
Recent policies to improve rural economic conditions have slowed the flow of migrants from the countryside .
Workers are demanding higher compensation to match the fast-rising cost of living in China 's cities , as manifested in an ongoing and high-profile labor strike at a Honda plant based in Guangdong .
Salary was the major point of contention .
Workers on strike demanded a raise in pay from the current 1500 renminbi -LRB- $ 234.00 -RRB- to 2000-2500 renminbi -LRB- $ 373.13 -RRB- per month .
Clearly , Chinese factories can no longer offer dirt-cheap prices .
Apparel production is a prime example of China 's declining competiveness in markets dependent on low-cost labor .
According to a study by the US consulting firm Jassin O'Rourke , labor costs in China are higher than in seven other Asian countries .
The average cost for a worker is $ 1.08 per hour in China 's coastal provinces and $ 0.55-0 .80 in the inland provinces .
India was in seventh place , at $ 0.51 per hour .
Bangladesh offers the lowest cost , only one-fifth the price of locations like Shanghai and Suzhou .
Adding to China 's labor woes , the financial crisis during the last two years had a disastrous effect on foreign demand .
In 2009 , China 's export value fell by 16 percent from 2008 .
Labor intensive industries were especially hard hit .
In the textiles industry , profits declined for the first time in ten years in 2008 .
In March 2009 , exports of electronics and IT products tumbled nearly 25 % from the previous period .
Although Chinese exports have begun to recover in 2010 , the impact of the financial crisis remains palpable .
By January 2010 , the value of exports has returned to its previous level in the same period of 2008 .
But many factories have already perished .
For Chinese manufacturers , a long-term trend of rising costs coupled with a short-term export slump were unprecedented challenges .
But the government and entrepreneurs are not idly sitting by as competitiveness slips .
These adverse conditions have inadvertently propelled a long-delayed restructuring of China 's labor-intensive industries .
As costs surge , Chinese producers are seeking higher value , new niches , and more influence over policymaking .
Along China 's dynamic coastal belt , local governments are drafting new economic blueprints to push their firms up the value-added chain .
Consider the case of a textiles manufacturing center in Jiangsu province , dubbed the `` silk capital '' of China .
Three-quarters of the city 's GDP had been coming from textiles production .
Last year , however , exports fell by about 15 % .
For local planners , the export shock was a wake-up call for change .
As a result , officials in Jiangsu are no longer content with sewing clothing .
Leveraging a mixture of administrative guidance and monetary incentives , the city government plans to reduce the share of garments in the output of textiles products by 25 % in three years and to increase the industrial applications of chemical fibers , which promise much higher returns than apparel production . Already , according to local officials , the city 's factories have acquired the ability to mass-produce super-thin fibers first designed in Japan .
In fact , the global meltdown may turn out to be a blessing in disguise for industrial upgrading .
Half of China 's toy factories went bust by the end of 2008 .
Though alarming in the short term , the eradication of small producers spells good news for those that survived the crisis .
As firms consolidate market share , they gain economies of scale .
Larger firms are more capable of pooling resources for research and development , which is the key to China 's aspirations to climb the value ladder .
Less fragmented industries also lobby better .
Traditionally , contract manufacturers in China are scattered and fiercely competitive .
They have little if any say over domestic and international regulations .
Producers in Jiangsu , for example , were forced to adapt constantly to fickle product-safety and environmental standards in export markets .
Compared to producers in the US and Europe , those in China are weakly organized and passive .
This could change .
As surviving firms gain in size , Chinese businesses may exercise more bargaining power vis-à-vis the Chinese government and foreign firms .
Exercising a louder voice in politics at home and abroad could mean reduced uncertainty for Chinese exporters .
Consider the strategy of Lenovo , China 's largest computer manufacturer ; it has hired a lobbyist in Washington D.C. , reportedly the first Chinese company to do so .
In decades to come , China can no longer sustain the cost advantages that defined its initial period of export success .
But it is a mistake to think that China 's manufacturing will remain in the doldrums .
Compared to many developing countries , China 's government is stable and embraces foreign investment .
Industrial clusters have been established in many parts of the country , where business connections can compensate for rising costs .
Domestic consumption is growing .
Further , as low-end , low-cost labor jobs morph towards higher-end , higher-cost jobs , China will move not only into more valuable manufactured goods , but also into the service industries , such as design .
When China 's labor-intensive industries emerge from their metamorphosis , we should expect to see firms that are larger , that invest more in product innovation and design , and that hold more sway over business and trade policies .
So `` Made in China '' is not losing international dominance yet .
A Fair Deal for Africa 's Resources
WINDHOEK -- Namibia is a resource-based economy that has embarked on an ambitious development program .
Our vision is to turn Namibia into a knowledge-based , diversified economy by 2030 .
One of the major principles upon which this vision is based is the idea of `` partnerships '' -- a major prerequisite for the achievement of dynamic , efficient , and sustainable development .
Partnerships between governments and foreign investors are at the core of the sound management of natural resources .
But such partnerships ca n't be taken for granted on a continent where the quest for natural resources has fueled decades of violent conflict .
Genuine partnership is difficult to achieve when resource-rich countries view foreign mining and drilling companies only as adversaries , seeking unfair and inequitable contracting agreements .
From the perspective of companies , partnership is unattractive when they are forced to incur large losses owing to project disruptions and contract renegotiations .
By contrast , partnerships are strengthened if companies and governments recognize their shared interest in durable , mutually beneficial contracts that ensure stable revenue streams from projects .
This requires a framework that takes into account , among other things , developmental possibilities , environmental concerns , labor conditions , and community interests , and that is adaptable to changing circumstances .
For governments , contracts are more likely to be durable if they are negotiated in a way that enables countries to receive fair and predictable long-term revenues .
For developing countries , this source of income can be substantial over several decades , and is needed by governments for investment in infrastructure , health care , education , etc. .
On the other hand , poorly conceived and negotiated contracts not only prevent countries from enjoying the full long-term benefits of their natural resources , but also help to entrench poverty , corruption , and even conflict , particularly when governance systems are inadequate .
For companies , contracts are more likely to be durable if they are negotiated in a way that continuously rewards firms for risky and capital-intensive investment in terms of the net present value of their earnings .
Companies also want , of course , contracts that wo n't be repudiated by the next government .
Indeed , poorly negotiated contracts are a recipe for adverse business outcomes , such as reduced security of mining titles , increased likelihood of operational disruptions from targeted civil protests , and greater risk of revisions to tax and other conditions .
Many governments in Africa simply do n't have the capacity to negotiate complex contracts that require a wide range of in-depth knowledge of law , finance , geology , economic modeling , etc. , while firms typically do .
As a result , the contracts that are negotiated often do not meet the criteria described above -- to the disadvantage not only of governments , but also of firms interested in durable contracts .
In the absence of conditions for equitable negotiations , governments often deem the resulting contracts unfair -- thus dooming them to be breached at some point .
In these circumstances , there is an urgent need for a facility that allows governments of poor countries to negotiate on a par with foreign investors to reach contracts that are as fair as possible under the given circumstances .
The time has come to establish such a facility -- in the interest of a mutually beneficial partnership between governments and foreign investors .
No Time to Slacken
No Time to Slacken PITTSBURGH -- Almost six months ago , at a moment of great alarm about the global financial and economic crisis , G-20 leaders met for a historic summit in London .
Their collective commitments to stimulate , regulate and restructure global economic activity helped to calm nerves around the world .
Many of the problems that spurred the London summit remain real .
Anxiety levels may have come down , in board rooms and stock markets , but the daily drama for survival continues . Indeed , for many people it has deepened , in the villages and streets of the world 's least-developed countries -- particularly in Africa .
The United Nations and the World Bank predict that the direct and indirect effects of the economic meltdown will be felt in the developing world for a long time to come .
Jobs have gone , incomes have been lost and opportunities foregone .
Tens of millions of people have been added to the hundreds of millions already below the poverty line , reversing progress toward attaining the world 's Millennium Development Goals .
The London G-20 meeting recognized that the world 's poorest countries and people should not be penalized by a crisis for which they were not responsible .
With this in mind , the G-20 leaders set out an ambitious agenda for an inclusive and wide-ranging response .
If the Pittsburgh summit is not to be an anticlimactic end to the G-20 's ascendancy as a forum for decisive action , the momentum generated must be maintained .
First , G-20 leaders need to follow through with the commitments they 've made to a Global Plan for Recovery and Reform .
Having recognized its `` collective responsibility to mitigate the social impact of the crisis and minimize long-lasting damage to global potential , '' the group now needs to review how much support has reached or become accessible to developing countries .
There are some encouraging signs .
For example , in July , the International Monetary Fund commendably announced a substantial increase in concessional lending to least-developed countries .
Several of them , including Ethiopia , Malawi and South Africa , have already been allocated Special Drawing Rights to help them cope with the economic crisis .
But some vulnerable countries are still struggling to finance countercyclical investment and expanded social protection services .
It raises questions about the stringencies of the World Bank 's eligibility criteria and allocation models which can prevent support of the most needy .
This underscores the case for a second area of action -- ensuring that developing countries , including least-developed countries , have a greater say in global financial institutions , and strengthening regional bodies such as the African Development Bank .
An equitable and fair global architecture means not only giving a greater say to the major emerging economies .
It also means systematically including other developing countries .
The Bretton Woods Institutions such as the World Bank and IMF themselves recognize that becoming more inclusive would make them more relevant to the reality and diversity of today 's global community and more effective as vehicles for addressing climate change adaptation and poverty reduction .
But the pace of change needs to be speeded up , ensuring that the IMF in particular is able to adapt to post-crisis challenges .
Architectural and institutional reform has to be complemented by a third achievement : agreement on a timetable for tackling the variety of biased trade rules , bloated subsidy regimes , intellectual property rules and other forms of market distortion which heavily disadvantage the developing world .
Here the G-20 could play a particularly constructive role , especially when it comes to the revival of the Doha Trade Round , the reduction of duties , tariffs and quotas on exports from the least-developed countries , and the gradual elimination of domestic subsidies .
Lastly , the G-20 could also help drive momentum on climate change .
Its members represent the vast majority of global greenhouse gas emissions ; agreement among them at Pittsburgh would go a long way towards ensuring that December 's international Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen does not end in hot air .
Progress is needed on emission-reduction targets and on sharing knowledge and technology more widely .
We also have to find a way to provide funding for adaptation and mitigation -- to protect people from the impact of climate change and enable economies to grow while holding down pollution levels -- while guarding against trade protection in the name of climate change mitigation .
The challenges of our time are many , complex and intertwined .
The G-20 in London was responsive to the concerns and special circumstances of the developing world , which resulted in some big thinking .
Sceptics fear that now that the collective financial threat is perceived , rightly or wrongly , to be manageable , the Pittsburgh Summit will result in a weak compromise that reflects divergent national interests rather than a sense of urgency about tackling climate change , chronic poverty and ineffective global governance .
G-20 leaders need again to manage difficult domestic pressures , overcome narrow agendas and resist populist temptations -- and prove the sceptics wrong .
Why Put Charles Taylor on Trial
Why Put Charles Taylor on Trial
We petitioned Nigeria 's Federal High Court last May to review the decision of Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo to grant refugee status to former Liberian President Charles Taylor , who is a fugitive from war crimes charges brought by a United Nations-backed Special Court in Sierra Leone .
We are two of Taylor 's many victims .
Seven years ago , we were young Nigerian businessmen trading in electronic hardware and medical equipment on Africa 's West coast .
We procured our supplies in Nigeria and exported them to Liberia and Sierra Leone .
In the summer of 1997 , David was in Monrovia when Charles Taylor was inaugurated President of Liberia following an eight-year civil war .
One year later , the UN and the Economic Community of West African States deployed soldiers as peacekeepers in neighboring Sierra Leone to guarantee a ceasefire in that country 's near-decade-long conflict , instigated by rebels of the Revolutionary United Front .
In the fall of 1998 , we traveled separately on business trips to Freetown , the capital of Sierra Leone .
On previous visits , we had heard reports of atrocities committed by RUF rebels , including amputations , rapes , and mutilations of civilians in the countryside .
But the presence of the international community reassured us that it was safe to do business in the country .
Both our home government and friends in Sierra Leone agreed .
We planned to spend the Christmas and New Year holidays in Freetown before returning to Nigeria early in 1999 .
Then our plans went awry .
Shortly before Christmas , rumors of an impending rebel assault began to filter into Sierra Leone 's capital .
First a trickle , then a deluge of internally displaced persons arrived .
We tried to change our flights and return to Nigeria , but there were no flights available .
On January 6 , the rebels overran the home where we were staying in Freetown .
The rebels - over one hundred of them , many young teenagers - surrounded our building , set it on fire , and ordered all Nigerians to come out .
Their commander , who spoke with a distinct Liberian accent , called himself Captain Goldteeth .
When we tried to escape , the rebels captured us .
Captain Goldteeth had us brought to a bus terminal next to our residence , where more than 80 other captives were assembled .
He said that he had instructions - from the Executive Mansion in Monrovia - to send a message to Nigeria , the leading troop contributor and financier of the regional peacekeeping force , ECOMOG .
Captain Goldteeth asked the `` cut-hand-cut-foot man '' to separate Nigerians from the others .
Then they began to amputate us .
Their first victim was Emmanuel 's younger brother , Benedict Egbuna .
They cut off his hands from beneath the elbow . He bled to death in front of his pregnant wife , Zainab , and us before he was dumped behind the house .
Many of our best friends were also mutilated and killed .
Next it was our turn .
The machete cut through Emmanuel 's flesh and bones but did not entirely sever them .
With hands dangling from his arms , the rebels dumped Emmanuel in the cemetery .
They then cut off David 's arms before setting him ablaze .
Neither of us knows how we survived this ordeal .
Benedict Egbuna 's five-year old son , Benedict Jr. , born five months after the slaughter of his father , is a source of comfort to both of us and to all who knew his father .
At a later point , Benedict will almost certainly also ask us what happened to those responsible for his father 's killing .
What shall we tell him ?
We have a duty to seek justice for the victims of Charles Taylor 's crimes .
Refugee status is a humanitarian shelter .
Nigeria must not let it be used as a tyrant 's shield .
The Philippines Joins the Asian Race
MANILA -- In 1980 , my father arrived in the United States to undergo a heart bypass , due to the rigors of his imprisonment by the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos .
The dictatorship offered him a reprieve , but , true to its nature , one dependent on its whims .
Having already been condemned by a kangaroo court to death by musketry , my father refused to hoist a white flag . `` The Filipino , '' he insisted , `` is worth dying for . ''
Three years later , my father went home , not to die , but to infuse new life into the demoralized ranks of the opposition to the dictatorship .
His assassination upon his arrival at Manila airport became the ultimate proof of the sincerity of what he had proclaimed throughout his life .
In 1986 , my countrymen peacefully defied Marcos 's tanks and demonstrated their faith in themselves .
Marcos fled , and democracy was restored without bloodshed .
My mother , who then became President , also had an enduring message : the democracy that we had regained at such a high price could be ensured only by a vigorous commitment to making its institutions work .
In 2009 , my countrymen again took to the streets to accompany my mother to her final resting place .
This massive expression of solidarity evolved into an effort to draft me to run for the presidency in 2010 .
At the polls , my countrymen conferred a solemn mandate on me to make democracy the means for eliminating corruption and alleviating poverty .
Our administration is committed to transforming a country where nice guys finish last into one where those who deviate from the straight and narrow face punishment for their crimes .
Our goal is to empower citizens to demand the rule of law , regardless of who is in power .
My colleagues in government are expected to demonstrate this by means of sustained reforms that foster meritocracy , transparency , and accountability .
We started with the National Food Authority , a government corporation tasked with ensuring an adequate supply of rice .
From 1972 to 2000 , the NFA accumulated 12.9 billion pesos -LRB- $ 290 million -RRB- in debt .
Within a year of taking office , my predecessor increased the NFA 's debt to 18 billion pesos .
In the course of the next eight and a half years , her administration imported much more rice than was needed , resulting in 177 billion pesos in debt by the time she stepped down .
In a shift from the illogical import policy of the past , we focused our energies on revitalizing rural irrigation , which boosted the first dry-season crop yields .
This year , our government will import 64 % less rice than in 2010 .
My father taught me that the most important freedom is freedom from hunger .
Without food security , individuals can have no chance of achieving social mobility .
That is why we are investing in our fellow citizens by means of a conditional cash-transfer program , called Pantawid Pamilya in Tagalog , which is patterned after Brazil 's Bolsa Familia .
We are also providing cash assistance to eligible poor families on the condition that pregnant mothers and children avail themselves of preventive health care , and that children regularly attend school .
This program already covers roughly 2.3 million poor families , providing them with yet another key to social mobility .
Mobilizing resources for these programs depends on cutting wasteful programs and rooting out corruption in our bureaucracy .
One agency where large-scale graft and corruption was traditionally rampant was the Department of Public Works and Highways .
By instituting open , competitive , and transparent bidding , the department has saved 2.5 billion pesos from 3,692 projects nationwide in the past year .
We expect 6-7 billion pesos in savings by the end of this year , which can be used for other high-priority development projects .
To promote fiscal transparency , our Finance Department has created a Web site called `` Pera ng Bayan , '' or `` The People 's Money . '' It allows the public to report tax cheats , smugglers , and crooks anonymously .
The government likewise subjects officials to lifestyle checks and vets their statements of assets and liabilities to find out if what they have acquired is commensurate with their declared income .
These campaigns are yielding results .
Sixty-seven tax-evasion cases and 43 smuggling cases , with claims totaling more than 26 billion pesos and 58 billion pesos , respectively , have been filed against groups and individuals .
But it is not enough to be efficient and honest in public spending .
We must also attract foreign investment , despite the difficulties facing Europe , the US , and Japan .
Our economic diplomacy has three key objectives , one of which is to secure more markets for our exports and enticing more tourists to visit the country .
Our diplomacy is also focused on protecting the well-being of the roughly ten million Filipinos working overseas .
But attracting investment to create jobs at home and ease poverty is the best way to ensure that our countrymen are not forced to go overseas in the first place .
Investment has been coming in , but more is needed .
Our Business Process Outsourcing industry is now the second largest in the world , behind India , with revenues of $ 8.9 billion in 2010 rising to a projected $ 11 billion in 2011 .
The Philippines also ranks fourth in the world in terms of shipbuilding .
Our sound fiscal management has been widely recognized , with all of the major credit ratings agencies upgrading the Philippines within our government 's first year .
And the World Economic Forum ranked us 75th in its latest Global Competitiveness Report -- a ten-spot jump from last year , and the Philippines ' highest ranking since it entered the survey .
The Philippines reopened for business under new management only a little more than a year ago .
It is faring very well -- and is set to become increasingly profitable .
Turkey , Europe and Middle-East Security
Turkey , Europe and Middle-East Security
Many factors contributed to the French and Dutch objections to the proposed EU Constitution .
One -- usually unstated -- factor is a fear of Turkish membership in the Union .
That membership drive , however , has already transformed Turkey .
In order to prepare for EU accession , Turkey has undertaken vast and serious legal , political , and economic reforms .
Turkey 's bureaucrats , politicians , and citizens united to fulfill the Copenhagen criteria for EU membership and tolerated the pain of the IMF-directed structural-adjustment programs .
The looming accession process will be even more painful , but Turkey 's people are firmly resolved to face this challenge .
Turkey 's transformation has already put an end to the Cold War-style security-state apparatus that ruled the country for half a century , and has changed the framework of the country 's domestic and foreign policy .
By modernizing and democratizing at home , Turkey 's politicians gained self-confidence in their ability to conduct a successful regional policy .
As a result , Turkey 's leaders are now willing to pursue active diplomacy in the Middle East in an effort to minimize problems with neighboring countries .
Of prime importance is the fact that Turkey is emerging as a role model for those across the Middle East who are seeking reform and modernization .
This influence does not imply a hegemonic relationship , but rather points to an alternative path for reform and economic development that other primarily Muslim countries might take .
The EU is associated with peace , democracy , and economic development , while the Middle East is characterized by instability , authoritarianism , and economic backwardness .
Turkey 's reform process shows that the latter is not an unavoidable destiny for the countries of the region .
In this respect , Syria and Iran appreciate Turkey 's EU membership process .
They consider a European Turkey an opportunity to develop their own relations with the EU .
Turkey also shows that the supposed clash between democracy and security -- and , indeed , between democracy and Islam -- can be reconciled .
Other Muslim states seem to grasp this : recently , a Turk was chosen for the first time and by a majority vote to be Secretary General of the Organization of Islamic Countries .
Turkey 's other major contribution comes through constructive diplomatic engagement in the region .
The Turkish government has adopted an active role as a promoter of peace and has reconfigured its policies toward a number of regional problems .
For example , Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan broke with tradition by displaying a critical attitude toward Israel 's more hawkish policies in the occupied territories , and did so without severing diplomatic relations with Israel .
During a visit of Turkey 's Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul to Israel in early January , there was serious discussion about Turkey assuming a mediating role between Israel and the Palestinians , as well as in future Syrian-Israeli talks .
Turkey , of course , did not join the US-led occupation forces in Iraq , but it has put enormous effort into mobilizing regional support for a stable Iraqi state .
Indeed , Turkish policymakers have , on a regular basis , brought the countries bordering Iraq together for discussions about the future of the region .
The United Nations Security Council has taken these meetings seriously and has requested further regional cooperation on the Iraqi question .
Turkey 's constructive engagement with the EU creates a sense of trust in the West -- among Western leaders at least , if not yet the general population -- for its regional initiatives . Yet Turkey is also succeeding in keeping an equal distance between both the EU and the US .
For example , Turkey is closer to the EU in its policies toward Iraq and Palestine , yet follows a line similar to that of the US in the Balkans and Cyprus .
In recent history , a variety of regional powers -- the Shah 's Iran and Nasser 's Egypt -- have arisen in the Middle East .
Turkey 's arrival as a regional power is different in that its democratic structures make an active peacemaker , not a local bully .
This is both a necessary and a promising role , for the region needs a local dynamic force pushing for reform , transformation , and peace .
Turkey 's experience shows that true security in the region requires internal stability and social peace .
With luck , this model can be exported throughout the Muslim world .
Resilient Brazil SÃO PAULO -- Less than a decade ago , Brazil 's economy faltered at the first sign of instability in international financial markets .
Today , by contrast , the country seems immune from global market turbulence -- or so Brazilian officials believe .
`` The sub-prime crisis has n't yet reached the beaches of Copacabana , '' Finance Minister Guido Mantega recently proclaimed .
`` We are growing free of imbalances and , in fact , gradually reducing our dependence on inflows of foreign exchange -- that 's key . ''
Indeed , the government has emphasized that Brazil will be even more insulated as efforts to cut spending reduce dependence on external capital flows .
But Brazil 's ability to escape the effects of a recession in the United States depends on the scale of the crisis .
Brazilian officials do have some reasons to boast that Latin America 's largest economy may be stronger than ever : macroeconomic indicators are healthier , solvency ratios have improved , and a mix of exports , investment , and domestic demand has been stimulating economic activity .
During the recent years of abundant global liquidity , the real grew stronger and the central bank was able to pile up foreign reserves , creating a cushion that totaled roughly $ 185 billion in late January , an amount sufficient to cover the entire foreign debt for the first time in history .
With foreign direct investment still flowing in , Brazil 's lower external vulnerability leaves the country in a much better position than ever before to weather the global storm -- at least for now .
Nevertheless , government officials admit , off the record , that the impact of an expected US recession will not be insignificant , because Brazil is not fully protected from external events .
Beyond the sub-prime crisis , concerns about the US financial system 's stability carry serious implications for the global economy .
Moreover , a recession or a slowdown in the US and Europe would hit Brazilian exports , narrowing Brazil 's trade surplus considerably .
In fact , although America 's trade significance has diminished , accounting for only 16 % of Brazilian exports last year , Brazilian trade and growth typically go hand in hand with the US and Europe ; historically they have never decoupled .
At the same time , an extended US slowdown could reduce foreign demand from other markets .
The scenario could worsen if there is a breakdown in commodity prices -- one of the most serious threats to Brazil from a global economic slump .
Deceleration in India and China would lead to further cuts in prices for raw materials , weakening markets whose strength has underpinned Brazil 's powerful trade performance in recent years .
In any case , the central bank has already projected that Brazil 's trade surplus will disappear this year , with a small deficit expected .
Fortunately , Brazil 's stock exchange has suffered less than other emerging-market bourses from the financial turbulence in the US and elsewhere .
Recently , the exchange has become the prime source of financing for Brazilian companies , ahead of the state-owned National Development Bank , which grants loans at below-market rates .
But Brazil 's financial markets are much more sensitive than trade to international disturbances , and monetary flows could decrease in the long term .
Indeed , should the global economy deteriorate further , outward portfolio investment could accelerate , reducing the financing available to Brazilian corporations and eventually affecting their ability to invest .
So far , business confidence is still high in the industrial sector , according to internal surveys conducted by the São Paulo Association of Industries , and inward FDI hit a record-high US$ 34.6 bn last year .
Optimistically , Brazilian officials believe that the government 's Growth Acceleration Program will serve as a vaccine against global turbulence and help reduce bottlenecks in the economy .
The positive growth outlook , following an estimated 5.1 % GDP gain in 2007 , is presented as a reliable defense against external contagion .
Nevertheless , the devil is in the details .
Global turmoil could derail Brazil 's expansion .
New obstacles for the Brazilian economy could lead to softening domestic growth and the internalization of inflation , bringing the crisis home .
Consequently , although the current crisis is expected to have a relatively minor effect compared to past upheavals , the possibility of contagion from turbulence in the US can not be disregarded .
It is therefore essential that Brazil 's private and public sectors do their utmost to sustain long-term growth by making the economic environment more business-friendly .
Beyond that , one can only hope that current external economic disturbances do not lead to a global disaster .
Brazil 's New Woman
It has set its economy on the right course , reduced poverty , lessened inequality , and consolidated its democracy .
The ghosts of the past -- authoritarianism , political persecution , and censorship -- have been left behind , as Brazilian democracy passed important tests such as the impeachment of a president and the rise to the presidency of a former trade union leader .
Brazil has now passed another test : having a woman at the height of executive power .
The challenges facing President-Elect Dilma Rousseff are huge , but so are her advantages .
The basis for continued rapid economic development has been established , and there is nothing to suggest the possibility of significant change in inflation targets , in the autonomy of the central bank , or in the floating exchange rate .
Rousseff owes her victory to outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and the success of his administration .
She knows that Brazil 's progress under Lula was supported by stable economic growth , higher social transfers to poor households through programs such as Bolsa Familia , and democracy .
But will this same formula still work for Brazil in the future ?
There are warning signs that more must be done , because economic stability does n't automatically produce dynamism .
Nor is democracy synonymous with strong institutions , and social protection can not substitute for an efficient labor market .
More investment is essential in order for Brazil to compete in the international market , and the country 's economy needs a jolt of innovation .
Productivity is low and the incorporation of new technology is still limited to an elite group of companies .
Without a structural transformation , Brazil will not be able to maintain its growth for long .
Of course , state intervention in the economy risks asphyxiating the dynamism of Brazil 's companies and private initiatives .
On the other hand , if the state does nothing , the economy 's structure could remain unaltered , leaving Brazil dependent on commodities .
There is no easy solution to this problem .
So the main challenge for the new president will be to continue Lula 's effort to build a new relationship between the public and private sectors -- a model capable of combining transparency and proactive measures that neither devolves into centralizing statism nor surrenders to the markets .
How Rousseff will manage this effort will be the clearest demonstration of her leadership abilities .
Lula 's eight years in office showed developing countries everywhere that the state can not do everything , while making no less clear to even the most orthodox that the interests of the markets do not always coincide with those of the country .
The state 's larger presence during Lula 's term in office helped Brazil find its way again .
The challenge in the next 15 years will be to consolidate the advances made , continue to reduce social inequality , and eradicate extreme poverty .
To succeed , support for tax , labor , and political reforms -- once a part of Lula 's agenda -- needs to be revived .
Brazil has come far , but in order to compete with China , India , South Korea , Russia , and other emerging countries , the predominance of low valued-added products needs to give way to the rise of an economy based on more innovative and dynamic firms .
Otherwise , the country will be condemned to shine weakly on the periphery of the global market .
Meanwhile , those segments of Brazil 's population that are newly arrived to the market , while enthusiastic about their social betterment , need lasting support to lock in the gains that have been achieved in their standard of living .
Indeed , a large part of the population subsists on low-productivity jobs .
Their progress , therefore , depends on real improvement in the quality of an education system that was designed for the Brazil of the past .
So , to the three pillars of Lula 's success -- economic growth , wealth redistribution , and democracy -- two more are now needed : education and innovation to consolidate Brazil 's economic growth and ensure higher-quality institutions .
Brazilian politics has n't always been admirable .
But today it is clear that Brazil has matured faster than its elite .
Let us hope that Rousseff continues to narrow this gap and can give Brazilians the country they deserve .
It will now be up to the UN General Assembly to provide final approval of the Protocol . If adopted , this instrument can make a real difference in the lives of those who are often left to languish at the margins of society , and are denied their economic , social , and cultural rights , such as access to adequate nutrition , health services , housing , and education .
Sixty years ago , the Universal Declaration of Human Rights recognized that both freedom from want and freedom from fear are indispensable preconditions for a dignified life . The Declaration unequivocally linked destitution and exclusion with discrimination and unequal access to resources and opportunities . Its framers understood that social and cultural stigmatization precludes full participation in public life and the ability to influence policies and obtain justice .
By contrast , Western governments were wary of this perspective , which they feared would hamper free-market practices , impose overly cumbersome financial obligations , or both . Thus , they chose to prioritize those civil and political rights that they viewed as the hallmarks of democracy .
In practice , this discrepancy created a category of `` alpha '' rights -- civil and political -- that took priority in the influential and wealthy countries ' domestic and foreign policy agendas . By contrast , economic , social , and cultural rights were often left to linger at the bottom of the national and international `` to do '' lists .
After its adoption by the General Assembly , the Protocol will enter into force when a critical mass of UN member states has ratified it . This should contribute to the development of appropriate human rights-based programs and policies enhancing freedoms and welfare for individuals and their communities .
Not all countries will embrace the Protocol . Some will prefer to avoid any strengthening of economic , social , and cultural rights and will seek to maintain the status quo . The better and fairer position , however , is to embrace the vision of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and promote unambiguously the idea that human dignity requires respect for the equally vital and mutually dependent freedoms from fear and want .
Latin America 's New Regionalism We live in a world crisscrossed by borders , drawn and redrawn throughout history , chosen by fancy or caprice , and all too often defended by bloodshed .
They have always been imperfect , and today their flaws are visible in new ways .
Waves of immigrants , driven from their homes by poverty and desperation , blend one nation 's struggles into another 's .
Climate change caused by environmental destruction in one place can cause floods , storms , drought , and famine anyplace , and easy global travel means that diseases travel more quickly .
Increasingly , we must recognize that our borders are not fortress walls .
They are simply lines that we have sketched in the air .
In short , no nation on this changing , shrinking planet can truly address its own problems in isolation .
Nowhere is this more true than in Latin America and the Caribbean , where the uneven blows of history and varied national policies have resulted in a patchwork of fates for our many peoples .
Today -- sometimes across borders , sometimes within them -- once-unthinkable wealth exists alongside extreme poverty and all its social ills .
Ours is a region of cruel contrasts .
Fortunately , many countries in this part of the world have recognized that regional welfare must be addressed as a regional challenge .
I am proud to list Costa Rica among them .
Our nation may be small , but our commitment to improving the well-being of this region is anything but .
We have an important role to play in advancing the principles of sound knowledge , quality decision-making , and transparency .
Costa Rica is the region 's most stable democracy , a place where peace , nature , and education are valued above all .
While we rejoice in our successes , however , we have long recognized that our future is tied to our neighbors ' challenges , whether they include military conflicts , as was true 20 years ago , or hunger and disease , as is the case today .
That 's why I am pleased that in October , the Inter-American Development Bank and the Copenhagen Consensus Center will host a conference in our capital , San José , inspired by the 2004 Copenhagen Consensus summit .
At that previous meeting , a panel of the world 's leading economic thinkers was challenged to answer this question : if an extra $ 50 billion were spent improving the state of the world , how could the money be allocated to achieve the most good possible ?
Those analysts realized that most , if not all , of the solutions to the world 's biggest challenges depend on local or regional contexts .
Therefore , the San José event will replace a global outlook with a regional one , with a new panel of experts focusing on the biggest challenges facing Latin America and the Caribbean .
The challenges fall into ten categories -- a familiar list of key issues in this part of the world : democracy , education , employment , the environment , fiscal problems , health , infrastructure , poverty and inequality , public administration , and crime .
The experts will face obvious restrictions .
Our resources are scarce .
We can not meet everyone 's demands , or solve all our problems at once .
We must choose between various good ideas , however difficult this may be .
The panel will produce a prioritized list of solutions that can serve as a set of guidelines for regional policymakers , helping us to be both ambitious and realistic .
The '' Consulta de San José , '' as the event has been dubbed , will produce practical ideas that leaders can implement , and help us to identify and promote cost-efficient initiatives .
Most importantly , however , it will serve to emphasize the importance of collective action .
Working together with a genuine sense of regional community is a challenge in itself , but one well worth addressing .
It has been said that `` good fences make good neighbors . ''
There is undeniable wisdom in those words , but it is time to reevaluate what `` good fences '' really are .
In today 's world , they must be low enough for us to shake our neighbor 's hand , understand his problems as we do our own , and find feasible solutions .
They must be built with the knowledge that no fence , wall , or even an ocean or a continent can truly divide us from the problems of others .
This is the spirit of the upcoming conference .
I hope that spirit will spread far beyond San José , and that other regions will join us in recognizing that while our borders may define our territories , having the courage to reach across them defines our character -- and , ultimately , our future success or failure .
Iran 's Revolutionary Echoes
Iran 's Revolutionary Echoes STONY BROOK , NY -- Iran 's continued unrest , now extending through the 30th anniversary of the revolution that toppled the Shah , raises the question of whether the Islamic Republic is about to fall .
As in 1979 , millions of Iranians have taken to the streets , this time to protest electoral fraud in the presidential vote last June .
The cheated presidential candidates , both veterans of the revolution , instinctively thought of a replay of history .
Mir Hossein Moussavi saw the green symbols of the demonstrators as representing the color of the House of the Prophet , and urged his supporters to continue their nightly rooftop chants of `` God is Great ! ''
Thus , the first slogan of the opposition invoked the religious credo of the 1979 revolutionaries .
More recently , protesters chanted it during the funeral demonstrations for Grand Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri in the closing days of 2009 .
And yet we risk being led astray by memories of 1979 .
It is far too soon to predict another revolution .
But t he divide between Iran 's society and its government is much greater today than it was under the Shah 30 years ago .
Change seems just as inevitable .
Technological advances greatly favor the 2009 protesters .
Text messages , Twitter , and the Web are infinitely superior to the smuggled cassettes of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini 's speeches that fueled the opposition in 1979 .
Indeed , the striking feature of the Iranian opposition movement is the lack of effective leadership , despite the astonishing persistence of protests .
As Moussavi has readily acknowledged , neither he nor the other presidential candidate , Ahmad Karroubi , feels in charge by now .
The greatest difference between 2009 and 1979 was created by the revolution itself .
R evolutions give birth to a new political class , and Iran 's Islamic revolution was no exception .
The Iranian leadership formed after the revolution consisted of a narrow ruling stratum and a much broader supporting group that was given charge of administration and political mobilization .
In the 20 years since Khomeini 's death , the composition of this political class has changed drastically .
The clerical elite has gradually lost power to the military-security groups , from whose ranks President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad emerged .
Bureaucratic and security services dominated by the Revolutionary Guards and its militia , the Basij -LRB- Mobilization Corps -RRB- , are now firmly in command .
The leader of the Islamic Republic , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , blessed the Revolutionary Guards ' decision to steal the presidential election .
By identifying squarely with the military-security apparatus headed by Ahmadinejad , Khamenei has alienated an important segment of the ruling clerical elite .
He has also reduced his own status as the ultimate arbiter in Iranian society , a role that was central to Khomeini 's dominance of the system .
As a result , he has produced a rupture between the two pillars of the revolutionary regime : the clerical elite and military-security structure .
The growth of Khamenei 's personal , extra-constitutional power introduces a strong element of uncertainty into Iran 's future .
Political regimes that rely on personal power , commonly known as dictatorships , prove to be fragile in crisis .
This was the weakness of the Shah 's regime , which collapsed as he became paralyzed in his decision-making .
There was nothing behind him supporting the system .
Khamenei 's backing of the June 2009 putsch now appears to be a costly mistake .
With this single error , he has undermined what had appeared to be a robust post-revolutionary course for the first and only theocracy in modern history . The cries of `` God is Great ! '' have now been overtaken by chants of `` Death to the Dictator ! '' in recent demonstrations in Tehran , Tabriz , Shiraz , and other Iranian cities .
The Iranian regime is now critically dependent on decisions made by one man , the Leader .
For that reason , it is demonstrating a degree of fragility that is comparable to the Shah 's regime in the latter part of the 1970 's .
Most spokespersons of the Green protest movement advocate civil disobedience instead of revolution .
Earlier this month , Ezattolah Sahabi , who was a member of the revolutionary provisional government in 1979 , issued a statement in Tehran stating categorically that `` a revolution in today 's Iran is neither possible nor desirable . ''
At roughly the same time , five prominent opposition intellectuals living in exile released a reformist , not revolutionary , manifesto directed against the `` despotic guardians . ''
But there is little chance that these children of the Islamic revolution -- now graying reformists -- will remain in control of the Green movement , which now reflects the aspirations of a post-revolutionary generation of young women and men and students .
The ayatollah-dictator and the Revolutionary Guards have tried their best to discredit their opponents by concocting , through forced confessions at show trials , a conspiracy of regime change based on a `` velvet revolution '' produced by `` Western social sciences . ''
Deep down , they know there is no conspiracy .
Their fear is grounded in what they see in front of them : the forward march of history .
Beyond the Sino-Japanese Rivalry
Beyond the Sino-Japanese Rivalry
China 's government has sentenced two of its citizens to life in prison for their role in securing prostitutes for hundreds of male Japanese visitors in the southern city of Zhuhai last autumn .
The Chinese government is also pressuring Tokyo to turn over the Japanese businessmen who allegedly requested the prostitutes .
This story made headlines around the world , and fits well with how the world press typically covers Sino-Japanese relations .
Regrettably , such incidents recur with enough regularity to feed the media machine that continues to stir a nationalism rooted in conflicting historical memories .
Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi 's annual visits to the Yasukuni Shrine - which is widely viewed as a symbol of Japan 's former militarism - is a conspicuous example of this .
The publicity that the press gives to these visits has helped impede an invitation to Koizumi from China 's leaders for a state visit .
Recently , the discovery of mustard gas canisters left behind by Japanese forces during World War II has also served to keep memories of the Imperial Japanese Army 's wartime conduct alive among older Chinese .
Moreover , rival Sino-Japanese claims to the Senkaku -LRB- or Diao Yutai -RRB- Islands resurfaced last year when the Japanese government leased three islets in the chain from private parties .
The action , purportedly undertaken to reduce the prospect of landings and demonstrations by Japanese right-wingers , set off a brief , though frenzied , reaction in China , as well as in Hong Kong and Taiwan .
Meanwhile , differences over Taiwan also foster tensions periodically , such as when former Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui sought to visit Japan for medical treatment .
But this is not the whole story .
Although such incidents reveal a troubling level of mistrust between the Chinese and Japanese that is not merely a product of media coverage , it is noteworthy that both governments have worked consistently , diligently , and with considerable success to resolve such problems and contain their political fallout .
Of course , official relations between the two countries are marked by much political and economic competition - some of it healthy , some of it a possible harbinger of future strategic rivalry .
The competitive strain in Sino-Japanese relations is especially visible in energy politics .
Demand for oil in Asia is growing rapidly , and with China and Japan increasingly dependent upon imports , each has naturally sought to improve its energy security by diversifying sources of supply .
Both countries covet access to Russian reserves , especially those located in the Angarsk fields of Siberia .
Last spring China appeared to have locked up a Russian commitment to build a pipeline to service the China market at Daqing .
Japan , however , raised the ante with new offers of financial incentives .
Its bid for an alternative pipeline to Nakodka to serve Japanese , Korean , and other markets remains alive , creating another point of competitive friction .
In their rivalry for leadership in promoting Asian regional cooperation , meanwhile , China has taken an early lead .
Two years ago , China trumped Japan by offering a Free Trade Agreement to the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations , while front-loading its own tariff concessions .
More recently , China , along with India , signed an ASEAN-proposed Treaty of Commerce and Amity , while the Japanese hesitated .
In addition , China has served as the principal broker in talks between the US and North Korea on nuclear issues , in which Japan has a huge stake .
But this backdrop of contention and competition masks emerging collaborative aspects of Sino-Japanese relations that are profoundly important , but which , unfortunately , seem to the world 's media to be too mundane to `` sell . ''
For example , trade and investment flows continue to expand rapidly .
Bilateral trade topped $ 100 billion in 2003 , as Japan 's exports to China increased by more than 10 % , fuelled by semiconductors , electrical equipment , and automobiles .
Meanwhile , China replaced the US as Japan 's biggest source of imports , and is now one of the few non-members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries with which Japan runs a trade deficit .
Similarly , direct investment by Japanese firms is increasing as they relocate production facilities to China to capitalize on lower labor costs and high-quality engineering talent .
Even the 20 % cut in Japan 's Official Development Assistance for China scarcely harmed their smooth economic ties .
Of course , there is no assurance that today 's expanded commerce will preclude eventual strategic rivalry , or succeed in erasing lingering wartime animosity .
But both countries now place a premium on extending their economic interdependence .
China sees economic ties as a way to hasten its modernization .
Japan sees them as a way to enhance its international competitiveness , and to provide China with incentives for geopolitical moderation .
Most importantly , a new generation of leaders in both countries seems less hung up on divisive memories .
They may also see in Europe 's surge toward economic integration a model for themselves and an inducement to intensifying regional cooperation .
Pragmatic leaders in both countries clearly recognize the benefits of diplomatic collaboration on issues that affect the region , such as North Korea 's nuclear ambitions .
Ultimately , the historical wounds that have long divided China and Japan , and the more current diplomatic flashpoints that the global media inevitably trumpet , only tell part of the Sino-Japanese story .
There are economic and geopolitical rivalries between China and Japan that dwarf in importance the high-profile insults to national pride that make headlines .
But there are also compelling economic and political inducements toward cooperation that prevent these rivalries from developing into full-blown crises .
Pinochet 's Trial , Chile 's Dignity
Pinochet 's Trial , Chile 's Dignity
The court battle on whether or not to punish former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet is now over .
After prolonged reflection on medical reports regarding Pinochet 's health , Judge Juan Guzmán found him mentally fit to stand trial on nine counts of kidnapping and one count of homicide .
Chile 's Supreme Court has now upheld that indictment .
All of those crimes were committed during `` Operation Condor , '' a Latin America-wide program among the continent 's dictators to physically eliminate their opponents on the left .
Judge Guzmán also determined that the former dictator is not insane and knows right from wrong .
This is critical , as Pinochet has sought to deny his competency .
A recent `` vascular incident '' that sent him to a military hospital -- where he regained consciousness and motor skills -- will furnish excuses to request new medical examinations and delays as criminal proceedings move forward .
But Guzmán 's efforts to bring the dictator to justice should not remain isolated .
Other judges and official bodies need to keep the pressure on Pinochet .
The investigation into the death in 1980 of ex-president Frei Montalva , the principal opponent of the dictatorship , has advanced but needs to be pursued vigorously in the courts .
Frei 's death implicates the repressive apparatus that Pinochet and Manuel Contreras , his `` right hand , '' managed in lockstep .
Operation Condor , the Riggs , Frei , and Prats affairs , and many other crimes are documented in the recent report on torture and political imprisonment written by the special commission established by President Ricardo Lagos .
Arriving 30 years after the military coup that brought Pinochet to power , the report has both unsettled and empowered Chileans .
Seemingly invincible for many years , the former dictator 's final collapse began in London in October 1998 , when Spanish lawyers , Judge Baltasar Garzón of Spain , and Scotland Yard brought charges against him .
Pinochet responded with arrogance , provoking a huge sense of shame for Chile 's young democracy .
Pinochet 's ability to evade the courts cast a dark shadow over the country 's military institutions and made many Chileans wonder how far the country had really gone in its transition to democracy .
Without Judge Garzón 's insistence on pursuing the matter , prosecuting Pinochet would have been nearly impossible , owing to powerful opposition from wealthy and media-savvy Chileans .
The Chilean government 's excessive caution -- rooted in fear of instability that could affect the basic rights regained after the dictatorship -- also helped Pinochet evade justice .
Indeed , Chile 's courts could not have garnered the necessary public support to free them from their inertia without the push Garzón provided .
It would also have been impossible to consider bringing Pinochet to justice without the extraordinarily important human rights struggles waged by victims ' organizations , victims ' families , and jurists who , against all the odds , remained true to their cause for decades .
Few organizations in Chile have been as capable or as successful as those dedicated to human rights .
Because of the tenacity and passion of ordinary Chileans demanding that the state fulfill its mandate to protect their human rights , Pinochet finds himself before the bar of justice , and others who used their power to kill , torture , or exile their fellow citizens are being pursued .
Yet many still wonder , `` Will Pinochet ever pay for his deeds ? ''
International public opinion and history have already condemned him .
Chile 's dignity now hinges on whether or not its legal system reaches the same conclusion .
Doubts that Pinochet will be punished exist because `` pinochetismo '' remains alive in Chile .
Powerful supporters defend him , using any underhanded means they can muster .
They are aided by the fact that some within the government would prefer to close a sorrowful chapter of human rights violations rather than bringing it to a conclusion .
Depending on the course the nation takes , Chileans may in time reconcile themselves to their past .
For now , their different views coexist and they live together peacefully .
But citizens and the state must also face the truth and bring human rights abusers to justice if people are to live honestly in their society and in history .
To the extent that Chileans do so , they will create the conditions for a more dignified and honorable society .
A judicial judgment against Pinochet is an important step forward .
People Power in the Caucasus
People Power in the Caucasus For the past month , women in Georgia who were displaced from Abkhazia during the 1993 conflict have witnessed history moving backwards ; everything they lived through 15 years ago is repeating itself .
These women are now hosting a new flood of displaced civilians from Abkhazia and South Ossetia after Russia 's aggression in those regions , as well as within the Georgian territories that Russian forces have occupied since the invasion .
In Tbilisi alone , there are more than 500 camps for internally displaced people , many of them women and children living with shortages of food and medical supplies .
Georgians today hardly feel supportive of their president , Mikheil Saakashvili , who , in a foolish attempt to regain control over South Ossetia , provoked Russia to drop its peacekeeping mission in the region and turn its full military might to pushing Georgian troops out of South Ossetia and Abkhazia , and then to occupying much of Georgia .
The Russians bombed numerous strategic and civilian targets in Georgia , destroying infrastructure and producing growing shortages of food , fuel , and medicine .
People are in despair ; they are angry at Russia for its aggression and at their own government for provoking this uneven conflict .
People of different nationalities and ethnicities have been living in this region side by side for centuries , sharing customs , traditions , bread and wine , and mutual respect for each another 's cultures and languages .
But , going back to the Russian , British , and Ottoman Empires that once battled here , they have been continually exploited by politicians and generals .
Women and children suffer the most in times of conflict .
Add to this centuries-old patriarchal traditions , 15-year-old post-war traumas , a 20-year economic crisis , and current Russian aggression , and you may begin to grasp what women in South Ossetia , Abkhazia , and Georgia are enduring these days .
Besides the general devastation that modern warfare brings , impoverished and angry Russian soldiers were wreaking havoc on civilians by stealing belongings left behind and raping women .
In addition , lawlessness was enticing bandits to cross the border and vandalize and rob properties left by fleeing refugees .
News reports and `` analysis '' by state-controlled channels in both Russia and Georgia that promote negative images of `` the enemy '' serve only to widen the gap between ethnic groups .
Over the past month , concerned citizens in both Russia and Georgia have started to make attempts to build alliances and reach out to each other outside of the government-controlled media and structures .
There have been action calls and statements circulated on the Web calling on the people of the region to unite and not allow governments to build bigger walls between them .
Despite government propaganda , the region 's people must remember that Russians are not superior to Georgians , Georgians to Ossetians or Abkhazians , and so on . We need to stop these territorial battles based on national pride and desire to control and rule .
Saakashvili must be pressured to abandon his effort to wield full control over Abkhazia and South Ossetia .
At the same time , the Russian government must be pressured to pull out of the Caucasus and let people there decide their future for themselves .
Now is the time for Georgian , Russian , Abkazian , and Ossetian civilians who are bearing the brunt of the conflict to come together to stop imperial chess games that kill thousands of people and leave thousands more displaced and emotionally wounded .
It is time to help civil society in this area build a world where peace , not warfare , is the rule .
Women 's rights activists in the region should not fall into a brainwashing trap of nationalism and territorial disputes , becoming another tool in the hands of politicians .
They should demonstrate to their governments that they will not succumb to divisive ideology .
Libya 's Lord of the Flies
LONDON -- `` I am a glory that will not be abandoned by Libya , the Arabs , the United States , and Latin America ... revolution , revolution , let the attack begin , '' said the self-described King of African Kings , Dean of Arab Leaders , and Imam of all Muslims , Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi .
The statement summarizes the Libyan regime 's extremely repressive response to the popular uprising against Qaddafi 's 42-year dictatorship .
But Qaddafi 's tactics have boxed him in .
Should he be defeated , finding refuge abroad , as Tunisia 's former President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali did , will be difficult . And internal exile , such as that currently afforded Hosni Mubarak , will be impossible .
Although the regime 's capacity to commit large-scale massacres has shrunk , Qaddafi 's defeat will come at a high cost in terms of human life .
In an extreme scenario , the regime could use chemical weapons , as Saddam Hussein did against the Kurds of Halabja in 1988 , or it could launch an intensive aerial bombardment campaign , as Syria 's Hafez al-Assad 's did in Hama in 1982 .
At that point , international intervention would be more likely than ever .
One and a half million Egyptians and many other foreign nationals , including British citizens , are in Libya and now are in an extremely vulnerable position .
In his first speech during the crisis , Saif al-Islam al-Qaddafi , the Colonel 's supposedly `` moderate '' son , alleged an international conspiracy against the regime , involving Egyptians , Tunisians , and other foreign agents .
The response of father and son has been to incite violence against foreigners .
Another possible scenario is a move by the army , or a significant part of it , against Qaddafi and his sons .
The problem is that the Libyan army has not been able to act cohesively since the protests began , in contrast to the Egyptian and Tunisian armed forces .
Senior and junior army officers have defected , often with their troops , to the regime 's opponents .
Two air-force pilots diverted to Malta , followed by a navy warship -- all in defiance of Qaddafi 's orders to bomb the eastern city of Benghazi .
But , at least so far , there have been no splits reported among the Revolutionary Committees , Qaddafi 's diehard loyalists , who are estimated to total around 20,000 fighters . The same is true of Brigade 32 , which is headed by another of Qaddafi 's seven sons , Khamis al-Qaddafi .
This brigade is in charge of protecting the Bab al-Aziziya area in Tripoli , where the Colonel lives in his ersatz Bedouin tent .
Libyan military Intelligence , headed by Abdullah al-Sonosi , the Internal Security Forces , led by al-Tuhami Khaled , and the Jamahiriya Security Apparatus also remain intact , with no reported splits .
True , the deep , ingrained rivalry and mistrust between Libya 's military-security apparatuses is likely to give rise to splits that will be a key factor in undermining the regime .
But , overall , the Libyan army 's tribal nature and allegiances prevent it from functioning as a single unit , either in backing Qaddafi , or in joining the revolt against him .
Tribal allegiances will play a pivotal role if Qaddafi is defeated in the coming days .
Historical rivalries , vendettas , and weapons are widespread among Libya 's tribesmen , which suggest that tribal warfare in the post-Qaddafi era is likely .
Yet signs from Libya 's East , now a `` Qaddafi-free '' zone , indicate otherwise .
Of course , inter-tribal rivalries are strong in eastern Libya . But the level of organization and coordination among those leading the rebellion has been quite impressive .
Security , medical , and other committees were rapidly established , just as similar rudimentary institutions of order were created in Egypt by rebellious protesters a few weeks ago .
Moreover , when Ahmed Qaddaf al-Dam and Said Rashwan , two leading figures in the regime , visited Egypt and attempted to recruit tribes with Libyan branches to attack the Qaddafi-free East from Egypt 's western desert , they came away with nothing .
Awlad Ali and the other tribes refused the generous bribes offered to them .
Libyan civil society is not as developed as its Egyptian and Tunisian counterparts , which further suggests that Qaddafi 's downfall could result in tribal warfare .
But the lessons of Iraq 's bloody post-Saddam civil war were learned across the Arab world , and the dedication and maturity of Tunisian and Egyptian youth has become a model for other Arabs seeking freedom and dignity .
Libya 's people may be more politically mature and sophisticated than many observers believe .
The international community has a fundamental legal duty towards Libya .
If generals and colonels like Abdullah al-Sonosi , Abdullah Mansour , and al-Tuhami Khaled , as well as Qaddafi and his sons , were placed on international watch lists , or if arrest warrants were issued against them , many of their subordinates would think twice before ordering their soldiers to shoot or bombard .
The West has known about crimes against humanity and terrorist plots committed by Qaddafi 's regime for decades , most notably the June 1996 Abu Selim massacre , in which more than 1,200 political prisoners were gunned down after protesting against prison conditions .
Yet there was no international inquiry , mainly because oil interests trumped moral outrage .
The West owes it to Libyans to protect them from another massacre .
So far , the Obama administration and European leaders have said all the right words .
But words are not enough ; it is time for concrete action .
Like Father , Like Son
LONDON -- `` The enemy of yesterday is the friend of today ... -LRB- I -RRB- t was a real war , but those brothers are free men now . ''
Thus spoke Saif al-Islam al-Qaddafi in March 2010 , referring to the leaders of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group -LRB- LIFG -RRB- , an armed organization that had attempted to assassinate his father , Muammar al-Qaddafi , three times in the mid-1990 's .
This may seem surprising .
A few days ago , the very same man promised Libyans a `` sea of blood '' if his father 's regime was toppled .
Indeed , Saif al-Islam , an elegant , soft-spoken graduate of the London School of Economics , has now become a prime suspect in massive crimes against humanity .
People like me , who study the tactics of Arab dictatorships and the causes of their persistence , are less surprised , if at all , by this turn of events .
Arab authoritarian regimes , unlike others that have given way to democracy , are incapable of self-reform ; they have , however , mastered the tactics needed to prolong the life spans of their aging despotisms .
Creation of a Hydra-headed security apparatus , mass-murder of opponents -LRB- both real and imagined -RRB- , widespread torture , and sustained censorship and repression are some of the common tactics used by Qaddafi , former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , former Tunisian President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali , Syrian President Bashar al-Assad , and other Arab autocrats .
But Qaddafi 's regime became an international pariah mainly for a series of terrorist plots abroad , not for crimes against humanity committed against Libyans .
Oil interests and the regime 's `` dovish '' face in recent years successfully extended its life .
Qaddafi 's dovish period coincided with the rise to prominence of his second son , Saif al-Islam , and his sister Ayesha , the latter becoming a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations .
Saif cultivated a reputation for being a `` reformer '' : he called for a national-reconciliation process with opposition groups , supposedly liberalized the media , supported charity and development initiatives , and most importantly , became a face that the West could talk to .
The two public fronts for those initiatives were Libya Tomorrow and the al-Qaddafi Foundation for Development .
Behind them , however , Libyan Military Intelligence , headed by Abdullah al-Sanosi , was giving conditional support and setting the general direction for their activities .
The `` reforms '' proposed by Saif al-Islam included releasing some political prisoners , especially those , like the LIFG , who declared their allegiance to Qaddafi 's regime .
But concrete steps leading to government transparency and accountability , such as inquiries into oil wealth and state expenditures , or serious investigation of crimes against humanity , were all beyond his will and imagination .
Despite the cosmetic nature of the `` reforms , '' other regime factions , most notably those led by Saif al-Islam 's brothers Mutassim , al-Sa ` adi , and Khamis , challenged them .
Behind the brothers were other security agencies : the Internal Security Forces , the Revolutionary Committees , and , to a lesser extent , the Jamahiriya Security Apparatus -LRB- Foreign Intelligence -RRB- .
When I visited Tripoli in March 2010 for a `` national reconciliation '' conference , the conflicting statements given by Saif al-Islam and security officials surprised me .
The head of Internal Security Forces , Colonel al-Tuhami Khaled , another principal suspect in the crimes currently being committed against Libyans , refused to call the process a `` reconciliation . ''
For him , it was `` repentance from heresy . ''
Given the recent wave of uprisings , it is more evident than ever that any `` reform '' initiatives undertaken in the Arab world previously were aimed only at sustaining repressive dictatorships and escaping punishment for criminal abuse of power .
The reform `` debate '' within these regimes boiled down to a struggle between different branches of the security-military apparatus over the best way to preserve the status quo .
Arabs , of course , have known for years that their rulers were beyond reform .
That is why , in order to have a chance to catch up with the rest of the free , developed world , many of them are now risking their lives to remove those regimes .
What is happening today in the Arab world is history in the making , written in the blood , sweat , and tears of the victims of decades of violent repression .
When asked by a journalist what I would like to say to Saif al-Islam if I were ever to meet him again , I replied : `` I hope to see you in the International Criminal Court , beside Mubarak and Ben Ali . ''
Millions of Arabs of my generation and younger would probably give the same answer if asked what should become of the men who controlled their present and sought to destroy their future .
Was Killing Bin Laden a Mistake ?
LONDON -- `` He lived a hero , he died a martyr ... if they killed one Osama , a thousand others will be born , '' says a comment on a Facebook group called `` We are all Osama bin Laden . ''
The group was formed one hour after US President Barack Obama 's announcement of the Al Qaeda leader 's death .
That Facebook group already has around 30,000 `` likes . ''
Moreover , there are more than 50 similar groups on Facebook .
Reaction to Bin Laden 's death on Al Jazeera and other Arabic news outlets has been mixed .
Some view the man considered a mass murderer in the West as an icon , and his death and burial at sea at the hands of American forces will not undermine that perception in the eyes of his sympathizers .
Indeed , Egypt 's former Mufti , Sheikh Nasr Farid Wasil , has already declared Bin Laden a martyr , `` because he was killed by the hands of the enemy . '' -LRB- Sheikh Wasil , it should be made known , has no links or known sympathies for Al Qaeda and he represents a very different Islamic school of thought . -RRB-
Aside from the mixed signals online , in the virtual world , the critical question is whether eliminating Bin Laden marks the beginning of Al Qaeda 's demise in reality .
Some terrorist organizations have , of course , collapsed following the death of their charismatic leader .
The case of Shoko Asahara , the founder of Aum Shinrikyo -LRB- the Japanese group that organized the Sarin gas attack on Tokyo 's subway in 1995 -RRB- , comes to mind here .
But capturing and trying violent leaders is probably a better marker of the end of such organizations -- the chances of such an outcome being higher when such leaders recant their views and call on their followers to lay down their arms .
Abimael Guzmán , the leader of the Maoist Shining Path in Peru , and Abdullah Ocalan , the leader of the Kurdistan Workers ' Party -LRB- PKK -RRB- in Turkey , are notable examples of this .
By contrast , far from causing the demise of an armed movement , the killing of a charismatic leader at the hands of his enemies can transform such a figure into a martyr .
Che Guevera was far more valuable to leftist militancy after his death than he was while alive .
Armed Islamism has its particularities , of course , but it also shares important characteristics with some of these groups , including the relationship between the physical elimination of a leader and organizational survival .
Decentralized organizations with relevant ideologies , operating in contexts full of conditions conducive to armed action , usually survive leadership losses , whereas hierarchical , cult-like organizations often do not .
Since 9\/11 , Al Qaeda has been far from a hierarchical , cult-like organization .
Abu Musab al-Zaraqawi 's Al Qaeda offshoot in Iraq demonstrates this well : the group was called Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia for recruitment and propaganda purposes , but it was quite autonomous organizationally and operationally .
When Bin Laden 's close collaborator Ayman al-Zawahiri asked al-Zaraqawi to avoid targeting Shiites , al-Zaraqawi instead escalated the violence against them .
Al Qaeda 's franchise model applies to Algeria , Yemen , North Mali , and Somalia as well .
And , like guerrilla movements of yore , Al Qaeda partakes of `` ideological front '' tactics : small urban cells and\/or vulnerable individuals subscribe to the ideology and self-recruit or self-start an affiliated cell .
In all of its decentralized modes of operation , Bin Laden mainly played the role of inspirational guide and iconic figurehead -- a role better played when dead by American guns than alive , hiding from them .
Consider Sayyid Qutb , the Islamist intellectual who influenced Bin Laden and others . Qutb was executed by Gamel Abdel Nasser 's dictatorship in Egypt in August 1966 , in an attempt to reduce his influence .
That tactic backfired badly .
Of the 98 fellow Muslim Brotherhood prisoners with whom Qutb discussed his new confrontational ideology in 1964 , 35 were strongly supportive , 23 strongly opposed , and 50 hesitant .
Despite his intellectual status and prestige , Qutb had failed to persuade the majority of like-minded inmates under conditions of repression .
But , no sooner was Qutb the intellectual executed than Qutb the grand martyr was born .
His supporters soon numbered in the thousands , rather than the dozens , and he came to inspire generations , not just individual inmates .
Moreover , Qutb was executed by an Arab Nationalist Muslim leader , whereas Bin Laden was killed by US Navy Seals . That makes a significant difference in the Muslim world .
Imprisonment , followed by recantation of violence , has become almost a trend in several jihadist groups , notably the 20,000-strong Egyptian Islamic Group , factions of the al-Jihad Organization in Egypt , and smaller groups like the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group .
Leading figures in armed Islamist movements have not only abandoned political violence , but have also de-legitimized it as a means for social and political change after spending periods in prison .
For example , Sayyid Imam al-Sharif -LRB- a.k.a.
Dr. Fadl -RRB- , an Al Qaeda ideologue for a decade , published several books denouncing armed activism , both theologically and on tactical grounds , after spending several years in prison .
The same applies to the Islamic Group , a movement implicated in violent acts in almost a dozen countries throughout the 1980 's and 1990 's , including armed insurgency in Egypt , bombings in the United States and Croatia , assassination attempts in Ethiopia , and training camps in Afghanistan .
In the 2000 's , the imprisoned leadership of the Group produced more than 25 books aimed at de-legitimizing political violence as a method for change .
Eliminating the `` spiritual guide '' -LRB- as opposed to the organizational leaders -RRB- of a militant group might be perceived as a political victory for a government in the short term , but it probably makes a comprehensive de-radicalization process less likely , and it will not necessarily mean the end of the organization in question .
For long-term results , capture is almost always more effective than killing .
Libya After Qaddafi
BENGHAZI -- Middle Eastern autocrats routinely warn their people of rivers of blood , Western occupation , poverty , chaos , and Al Qaeda if their regimes are toppled .
Those threats were heard in Tunisia , Egypt , Yemen , Bahrain , Syria , and -- rendered in black-comedy style -- in Libya .
In short , freedom is worth the price .
In Libya , four scenarios may negatively affect prospects for democratization : civil\/tribal war , military rule , becoming `` stuck in transition , '' and partition .
Given the high price Libyans have paid , those scenarios should be prevented rather than cured .
The civil\/tribal war scenario is the worst risk .
Egypt 's revolutionaries understood this .
When sectarian violence erupted there following the removal of Hosni Mubarak , the revolutionary coalitions adopted the slogan , `` You wo n't gloat over this , Mubarak . ''
Repressive dictatorships can not win free and fair elections . But they can use extreme violence to consolidate their control over the state , its people , and its institutions .
So , to win , Libya 's Colonel Muammar el-Qaddafi has deliberately and successfully turned a civil-resistance campaign into an armed conflict .
That will have ramifications in the post-authoritarian context .
A study published by Columbia University on civil resistance has shown that the probability of a country relapsing into civil war following a successful anti-dictatorship armed campaign is 43 % , versus 28 % when the campaign is unarmed .
According to the same study , which was based on 323 cases of armed and unarmed opposition campaigns between 1900 and 2006 , the likelihood of democratic transition within five years following a successful armed opposition campaign is only 3 % , compared to 51 % when campaigns were unarmed .
Libya , of course , can survive the gloomy prospect of post-authoritarian civil war .
But this requires containing tribal and regional polarization , as well as the rivalries between the Interim National Council -LRB- INC -RRB- and the Military Council -LRB- MC -RRB- , and between senior military commanders .
Violent polarization has developed not only between Eastern and Western tribes , but also between some of the Western tribes .
Last month , for example , armed clashes erupted between rebels in al-Zintan and the villagers of al-Rayyaniya , 15 kilometers away .
Six people were killed -- a reminder of what can happen if violent polarization continues between neighboring towns and villages .
Vendetta politics is not unknown in Libya , and , in an armed society comprising more than 120 tribes -- including around 30 with significant numbers and resources -- it can become extremely dangerous .
Another negative scenario is military rule .
Several figures from the `` free officers '' -- the group that plotted the 1969 coup against the monarchy -- are leading the INC. .
They include General Abd al-Fattah Younis , General Soliman Mahmoud , Colonel Khalifa Haftar , Major Mohamed Najm , and others .
Those figures hold a mix of historical legitimacy , for participating in the 1969 coup , and current legitimacy , for helping the 17th February revolution .
They also belong to several large tribes , guaranteeing wide tribal representation if a military council were to take power , as in Egypt .
Unlike Egypt , however , whoever takes power in Libya will not necessarily inherit poor economic conditions that could threaten their legitimacy and undermine their popularity .
This might lead a group of senior officers to rule directly , especially if victory in Libya comes militarily .
A move by army officers in Tripoli against Qaddafi and his sons might end the conflict , with military commanders getting the credit -- and the political capital .
But four decades of military-based dictatorship may be enough for Libyans , a majority of whom never really benefited from their country 's wealth or potential .
When it comes to producing terrorists and undocumented immigrants -- two critical issues for Europe -- Arab military dictators have an inglorious record .
Algeria in the 1990 's is a potent reminder of this , and Western governments do not want the vicious cycle of repressive autocrats producing violent theocrats and refugees to restart .
Getting `` stuck in transition '' is a third possible scenario , with Libya remaining in a `` gray zone '' -- neither a fully-fledged democracy nor a dictatorship , but `` semi-free . ''
This means regular elections , a democratic constitution , and civil society , coupled with electoral fraud , skewed representation , human rights violations , and restrictions on civil liberties .
Getting stuck in transition usually kills the momentum for democratic change , and widespread corruption , weak state institutions , and lack of security serve to reinforce a myth of the `` just autocrat . ''
Unfortunately , a study published in the Journal of Democracy showed that out of the 100 countries that were designated `` in transition '' between 1970 and 2000 , only 20 became fully democratic -LRB- for example , Chile , Argentina , Poland , and Taiwan -RRB- .
Five relapsed into brutal dictatorships -LRB- including Uzbekistan , Algeria , Turkmenistan , and Belarus -RRB- , while the rest were stuck somewhere in transition .
Given Libya 's lack of democratic experience , some view this as a likely outcome in the post-Qaddafi era .
But Libya is not the only country that has tried to move from dictatorship to democracy with weak institutions and strong tribal identities .
Albania , Mongolia , and India successfully passed more complicated tests -- and offer some useful lessons in democratic transitions under unfavourable conditions .
The fourth scenario is partition , with the old three-province , Ottoman-style setup commonly mentioned : Cyrenaica -LRB- east -RRB- , Fezzan -LRB- south -RRB- , and Tripolitania -LRB- west -RRB- .
Cyrenaica is Qaddafi-free , Tripolitania is not , and Fezzan did not fully join the revolution .
But the administrative borders of these districts were never fully established , and they have changed at least eight times since 1951 .
In 2007 , Libya had 22 sha ` biya -LRB- administrative districts -RRB- , not three .
All of these scenarios will be affected by outcomes in Egypt and Tunisia .
In the case of democratic transitions , a success nearby often helps at home . Either country , or both , could offer Libya successful transition models , erecting an important obstacle to military dictatorship or civil war .
Mubarak 's Last Laugh ?
CAIRO -- August 3 , 2011 , will be remembered as a historic day in Egypt .
Former President Hosni Mubarak was put on public trial , together with his two sons and his ex-interior minister , General Habib el-Adly .
The repercussions for Egypt , indeed for the entire Arab world , will be profound .
This is not the first time that an Arab dictator has been put on trial .
Saddam Hussein and Zine El Abidine Ben Ali preceded Mubarak in the dock .
Hussein was tried with the help of a United States-led coalition ; Ben Ali was tried and convicted in absentia , after fleeing to Saudi Arabia .
`` That is why we are so proud of it . ''
But the run-up to the trial was contentious .
On July 29 , many organizations staged a large protest in Cairo 's Tahrir to highlight the unity of Egypt 's revolutionaries -LRB- whose demands included a public trial of Mubarak -RRB- .
Instead , the protest exposed the dramatic polarization between Islamists and secularists since Mubarak 's ouster .
Moreover , it revealed the potent capacity of Egypt 's Salafis to mobilize supporters , who were the overwhelming majority in Tahrir Square that day .
Other groups , including the leftist April 6 Youth Movement and the multi-ideological Coalition of the Revolution 's Youth , looked minute and insignificant .
As a result , many secular activists ended their week-long sit-in and withdrew from Tahrir Square .
Ironically , this was what the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces -LRB- SCAF -RRB- wanted , and it was achieved at no cost in violence or military tribunals .
Chants of `` islamiyya , islamiyya '' -LRB- Islamic , Islamic -RRB- were enough .
With no representative institutions and the military in control of the country , street mobilization has become the main tool of Egyptian politics .
Following the March 19 referendum , in which most Islamists campaigned for a package of constitutional amendments and got 77 % support , secularists took to the streets , mobilizing behind their own demands .
Those demands were mostly uncontroversial for Egypt 's revolutionaries , including Islamists : the release of political prisoners ; a halt to military tribunals for civilians ; prosecution of the murderers of protesters -LRB- many of whom are senior police officers -RRB- ; a purge of corrupt Mubarak allies from the police force ; and a public trial for Mubarak and his regime 's top henchmen .
Fearing that elections might bring an Islamist majority to Parliament and to the assembly that will write a new constitution , most secularists demanded supra-constitutional principles -LRB- akin to a bill of rights , with a few twists -RRB- or a constitution to be enforced by the SCAF before elections .
They staged street demonstrations , mobilized media pressure , and lobbied the SCAF .
It worked .
The SCAF announced that it is forming a body of constitutional experts to craft several versions of a potential constitution .
Obviously , the SCAF has its own calculations , which probably have less to do with protecting a liberal Egypt than with protecting the military 's financial independence and shielding itself from accountability to civilian institutions .
The secularists ' gains were a wake-up call for the Islamists , and they responded en masse on July 29 .
But Egypt 's old-line Muslim Brotherhood , with all of its factions , tendencies , and offshoots , no longer appears to be the country 's dominant Islamist force , as Salafis challenge the Brotherhood 's traditional hegemony .
The Salafis are defined in part by their strict theological orthodoxy .
Their belief in the superiority of literal interpretations of Islamic texts and their deep animosity towards religious innovation -LRB- broadly defined -RRB- reflect their certainty that the first three generations of Muslims possessed the best understanding of Islam , and should provide guidance for future generations .
But Salafism is also a powerful source of personal identity , shaped and reinforced by a common form of dress and style of beard , a high degree of social conservatism , and a generally negative -LRB- but nuanced -RRB- perception of liberal individualism .
`` I raise my head high as I am an Egyptian , and I raise my head even higher as I am a Salafi , '' an assistant of a leading Salafi sheikh proudly told me .
At the same time , Salafis ' social origins , organizational structures , political behavior , and even their views on democracy , violence , and state authority , are quite varied .
That has been the pattern observed in Algeria , Saudi Arabia , and Yemen .
Egypt may follow .
At the moment , Egyptian liberals ' main concern should be their popular appeal and ability to mobilize support , rather than picking fights with the Salafis and trying to enforce a constitution by any means , democratic or not .
During its transition period -LRB- 1988-1991 -RRB- , Algeria 's secularists crafted a pluralist constitution that excluded religious parties .
Yet , when parliamentary elections were held in 1991 -- more than two years after the constitution was adopted -- the Islamic Salvation Front still won .
The Algerian secularists ' strategy of exclusion , fraud , cheating , and gerrymandering backfired badly : Islamists were perceived as victims , while secularists -- with some exceptions -- were cast as unprincipled opportunists .
Enforcing a secular constitution before elections does not guarantee a secular outcome .
Unity among the former revolutionary opposition is critical for the success of any democratic transition , and Egypt is no exception .
The public trial of Mubarak shows what united demands can achieve .
Egyptian and other Arab revolutionaries should therefore keep the lessons of July 29 and August 3 in minds .
Unity now can bring justice and freedom later .
Catalyzing Consumption and Balancing Growth
Catalyzing Consumption and Balancing Growth WASHINGTON , DC -- China has weathered the Great Recession well .
The world now waits to see if last year 's impressive domestic demand growth can be sustained , and if China can , in the words of Prime Minister Wen Jiabao , `` give full play to the leading role of ... consumer demand in driving economic growth . ''
The Chinese consumer has been held back for too long , and now must be put front and center in China 's growth model .
China 's government is already moving ahead on multiple fronts to attain this goal as was clear from announcements at this week 's National People 's Congress .
Of the many factors that have decreased the share of consumption in China 's economy , declining household disposable income has been central .
That , in turn , has reflected the fall in labor income as a share of the economy , owing in part to structural changes that have moved workers out of agriculture -LRB- where the labor share of income is high -RRB- and into manufacturing -LRB- where capital commands a larger share of income -RRB- .
Concurrent with diminishing labor income , government-imposed ceilings on bank deposits -- the primary savings vehicle for most households -- have held down household capital income .
This fall in income has been magnified by rising household savings rates , driven by insufficient insurance for health care and old age , the high cost of education , growing income inequality , and demographic trends .
Recently , I attended an IMF-organized workshop in Beijing that brought together Chinese officials , academics , international analysts , and IMF staff to discuss how best to catalyze household consumption in China .
Participants emphasized that changes would be needed in multiple areas , including improving the system of taxation and social insurance , further developing housing and the service economy , and eliminating a range of relative price distortions .
One key idea was to lighten the tax burden on labor . Taking into account the personal-income tax and various social contributions , taxation of labor income in China is too high . To be sure , taxes are needed to finance social spending , but revenue sources other than taxes on labor income could do the job .
China could usefully explore shifting part of the burden from labor toward property , capital gains , and inheritance taxes .
Larger dividends paid to the budget from the highly profitable state-enterprise sector could also provide an alternative source of funds .
Another route to improve consumption could be to offer households greater support . The global crisis has prompted China 's government to push ahead with its social-reform program .
Important improvements have been made over the past year to expand the pension system 's coverage , move toward universal health care , and provide public funding for basic education .
But more can be done to speed up the existing reform package , find ways to develop full coverage for catastrophic health events , and develop government-backed financing of tertiary education .
Fixing the housing market could also help spur consumption .
Distortions in the real-estate market are a powerful motivation for saving , particularly among young people who struggle to meet the high down-payment needed to buy a first home .
Part of the high cost of housing arises from an underdeveloped financial system , which makes housing one of the few alternatives to bank deposits as a store of value .
Property or capital-gains taxes could help curb demand for housing as an investment vehicle .
In addition , a comprehensive nationwide housing policy is urgently needed to ensure that housing remains affordable , particularly for those on limited incomes .
Related to this is the need for improvements in the overall financial system .
By developing markets for private pensions , commercial health insurance , and annuities , China could complement expanded government provision of social insurance and weaken the incentives that underlie high precautionary saving .
Similarly , broadening the range of available savings instruments could raise household disposable income and increase consumption .
A more developed financial system would provide alternatives to real estate as a store of value , thereby making home ownership more accessible .
These issues will be examined carefully during the course of this year as the Chinese government and the IMF collaborate on a Financial Sector Assessment Program for China .
Fostering a dynamic service economy will invariably boost consumption as well . In the coming years , a more fully-fledged service economy will be an essential ingredient to increase employment and lessen China 's reliance on manufacturing .
But spurring faster growth in services is a complex undertaking .
Entry barriers , particularly in service industries dominated by state-owned oligopolies , need to be lowered .
Distortions in key prices that favor capital-intensive manufacturing need to be removed by raising the cost of land , energy , water , and capital .
Changing the tax structure will also help .
At present , industry is the primary source of tax revenue for the government , particularly at the local level , giving the state too little incentive to foster a service economy .
Finally , a stronger renminbi ought to be an integral part of the package of reforms to boost consumption .
A stronger currency would increase household income .
It would also create a powerful incentive for companies to expand into the service economy , providing more jobs and more choices for Chinese consumers .
The Vanishing Swedish Exception ?
The Vanishing Swedish Exception ?
For the past two years , Western Europe 's voters have been turning rightward .
In Denmark , France , Italy , the Netherlands , Norway , and Portugal , concerns about immigration , chronic unemployment , high taxes , and deteriorating public services have fuelled this trend .
But as Europe 's most recent parliamentary election shows , Sweden 's Social Democrats -- in power for 61 of the past 70 years -- remain relatively immune to serious challenges from the right .
Opinion polls just a few months ago gave the Social Democrats 44 % popular support .
Together with the former Communists and the Greens , the left held a comfortable 12-15 % lead over the four non-socialist parties .
This margin shrank dramatically during the campaign , and the left retained power by the skin of its teeth , but the lead ultimately proved insurmountable .
Why has Sweden held out against the right-wing tide sweeping so much of Western Europe ?
The immediate reason for Social Democracy 's enduring appeal is foreign policy .
In early 2001 , Sweden held the EU presidency , giving Prime Minister Göran Persson , the country 's dominant politician , a bright spotlight in which to shine .
Persson exudes competence and authority .
He bolstered his image considerably after winning the 1994 election by tightening government finances and eliminating a huge fiscal deficit .
But he has done nothing remarkable since winning again in 1998 .
Sweden 's economy rose and fell with the IT bubble , reflected in telecoms giant Ericsson 's troubles today .
Persson 's main advantages entering this year 's campaign were that he was unencumbered by new promises and was well equipped to run a presidential-style contest based on his personal appeal .
In 1970 , GDP per head was the fourth highest in the world ; now it is 17
One reason for this relative malaise is that Sweden remains the world leader in taxation , with public expenditures claiming nearly 60 % of GDP .
Conservatives demand lower taxes , but this is unpopular : almost 65 % of Swedes live on public salaries or social transfers .
Unlike other Europeans , Swedes are thus much keener to keep taxes high , which guarantees a large left-wing vote .
Even so , Swedes fret about the deteriorating quality of services provided by the social welfare system .
They complain about year-long waits for eye operations and hip surgery -- a direct result of a Social Democratic reform of 1994 that abolished the right of patients to seek alternative care at public expense if they are not treated within three months by their regional council .
The Social Democrats shrewdly reversed themselves on this point during this year 's campaign , but health care entitlements have clearly gone too far .
No less than 14 % of Swedish employees are currently registered as sick , double the number five years ago .
The Social Democrats argue that this reflects a serious health problem , while non-socialists suggest that the system is defective .
Many Swedes have come to believe that it is their right to register as sick regardless of their health .
Deteriorating public education poses another worry .
Stockholm , ruled by conservatives and liberals , has extended its free-market experiments , such as privatization of subway trains , to education vouchers and free choice of alternative schools .
The Social Democrats lost miserably in the capital .
As in most recent European elections , immigration loomed large , but as usual , Sweden was out of step with other countries .
The small Liberal party , which campaigned in favor of free labor immigration , tripled its support .
The Liberals make the sensible argument that anybody with a job should get a work visa , but that knowledge of Swedish be a citizenship requirement and that unemployed immigrants be barred from receiving social benefits for five years .
Roughly 70 % of Swedes support free immigration of laborers -- far higher than elsewhere in Europe .
They see that immigrants tend to be qualified East Europeans , many of them physicians , while the number of Swedes registered as sick or in early retirement has underpinned a severe labor shortage .
But Prime Minister Persson , kowtowing to the trade unions , insists on blocking labor immigration altogether for the next decade .
Although this stance cost the Social Democrats many votes , it was hardly enough to offset their main electoral advantage : the unseemly control over key public goods that the party has accumulated during its long incumbency . For example , the two dominant state-owned TV channels are under strict Social Democratic supervision , and the party also controls professorial appointments and academic research through politicization of funding agencies and university boards .
After so many years of Social Democratic rule , a large political caste has also developed .
The main qualification of two current ministers is that their parents were ministers .
The party itself is awash in trade union money , which is exempt from taxation as a result of sheer cronyism .
But Swedes have shown that still like the welfare state .
While they worry about the quality of public services , they are not prepared to join Europe 's rightist revival .
So Sweden 's Social Democrats do n't have to concede much to remain remarkably strong -- even if this weakens the integrity of Swedish democracy .
With the arrest of Russia 's richest man , oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky , Russia has lurched into a deep political crisis .
Unwittingly , President Vladimir Putin has opted for an all-or-nothing victory over the oil oligarch .
At stake is nothing less than Russia 's frail democracy .
The legal charges against Khodorkovsky concern old privatization and tax evasion cases .
But the charges against Khodorkovsky are as flimsy as they are tendentious : the privatization case had been amicably settled previously , and Khodorkovsky has merely used tax avoidance schemes that are commonplace in Russia -- and that have been upheld in court .
Putin 's real problem is that Khodorkovsky is too powerful and independent for the straitened politics he wants .
During his four years in power , Putin has advanced four major policies .
The first three -- free market reform , the rule of law , and a pragmatic foreign policy -- have been widely acclaimed , while the fourth -- `` managed democracy '' -- has been tolerated because it has brought political stability .
But `` managed democracy '' now threatens to unravel all three of his real achievements .
Khodorkovsky is the fourth major businessmen taken out of action by the authorities .
Four independent TV channels have also been taken over by the state , and no criticism of Putin is permitted in significant media .
The main polling organizations have also been brought under Kremlin control .
Regional elections are regularly manipulated , often by disqualifying leading opposition candidates .
The pattern is evident : a systematic authoritarian drive is underway .
Russia 's oligarchs are undoubtedly unpopular , and Khodorovsky 's arrest was evidently aimed at boosting Putin 's prospects in the looming parliamentary and presidential elections .
But although Russians dislike the powerful , and cherish underdogs and martyrs , a man in jail no longer looks strong .
With Khodorkovsky 's arrest , the authorities flaunted their extralegal and arbitrary powers in such a way that they have aroused widespread public worry .
Previously , Putin had enigmatically appealed to most Russians .
By balancing between ex-KGB people and big businessmen , he seemed independent of both .
Now he has antagonized all big businessmen ; he even refuses to meet them .
Suddenly , he has reduced himself to KGB President , jeopardizing the very political stability he sought to guarantee .
Putin has spoken continuously about the need for the rule of law , but in his TV statement on October 27 , he effectively stated his preference for law enforcers .
Indeed , in the Khodorkovsky affair , all procedural requirements have been blithely neglected .
For example , although prosecutors control the relevant courts , they did not bother to secure the necessary court orders for the Yukos raids and arrests .
The obvious conclusion that even ordinary Russians are drawing is that neither property rights nor people are safe .
Investments are likely to be stopped or delayed .
Those who can export capital will do so .
An emerging panic seems certain to dampen today 's strong growth .
The fallout from Khodorkovsky 's arrest is felt abroad as well .
The world 's business press has roundly condemned the authorities ' behavior , especially the impounding of Yukos shares worth many times more than possible state claims , which smacks of expropriation .
Foreign governments are voicing their fears .
In one stroke , Putin has jeopardized his considerable accomplishments .
With his public bluntness , he has discarded his prior coyness and deprived himself of deniability .
As the KGB culprits keep quiet , the President must do most of the talking , exposing himself further .
But why defend the arrest in a televised statement ?
Why refuse to meet Russia 's business elite , while meeting with foreign investment bankers ?
Why seize Yukos shares and licenses ?
A couple of weeks before his arrest , Khodorkovsky told me : `` I do not understand how they can win , given how many mistakes they make . ''
His words seem prescient .
The situation in the Kremlin appears reminiscent of the spring of 1996 , when a group of KGB men , led by President Boris Yeltsin 's chief bodyguard , General Alexander Korzhakov , almost seized power .
But the oligarchs mobilized behind Anatoly Chubais , who ousted Korzhakov and his circle by June .
Once again , Russia 's big businessmen have united behind Chubais .
If Putin wants to save his own skin , he must act fast and sack his top KGB aides in the Kremlin and the Prosecutor General .
It is worth recalling that in 1999 former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov were seen as a shoo-in ticket for the presidency .
But , having curried favor with Russia 's media , they were unaccustomed to criticism -- and rendered helpless when it appeared .
The taboo against criticizing Putin is already powerless .
The main liberal parties -- the Union of Rightist Forces and Yabloko -- are attacking him ferociously , while the faceless parties that supposedly support him are silent and confused .
They are presumed to be on the verge of winning an overwhelming majority in the parliamentary elections due on December 7 , yet like Korzhakov and his clique , they could be routed .
Indeed , by alienating big business and letting his wily chief of staff , Alexander Voloshin , resign , Putin has deprived himself of crucial electoral resources .
His former chief political advisor has even accused him of using `` Stalinist measures . '' If Putin falls short of the high expectations in the upcoming parliamentary election , his fortunes in the March 14 , 2004 , presidential vote may be jeopardy .
By arresting Khodorkovsky , Putin has revealed his authoritarian nature to the entire world .
He has thrown a gauntlet in the face of Russia 's civil society and business elite .
They have little choice but to resist , and their strength should not be underestimated . The battle for Russian democracy is joined anew .
Putin 's Last Stand
Putin 's Last Stand
Russia 's President Vladimir Putin was incredibly successful in achieving his goals during his first term .
He strengthened the power of the federal government , while defeating big business , free media , the communist party , the liberal parties and civil society .
Within government , he squezzed regional governors , both chambers of parliament and even the government apparatus , concentrating all legislative , executive and judicial power in himself .
Alas , Putin 's success may lead to his downfall .
He was fortunate during his first term because he recognized limits to his power .
An avid reader of opinion polls , he tried enigmatically to be everything to all voters .
Now , he seems to think himself free of constraint , but no politician is that lucky .
Putin is violating too many rules of politics , and just can not stop .
Putin is too jealous of power to delegate . Because he wants to make all decisions , he replaced a strong prime minister and chief of staff with two men unable to make decisions .
So rather than creating a strong vertical command , he paralyzed his government .
One reason for this extreme overcentralization is that Putin does not trust anyone .
Another reason is his preoccupation with secrecy .
A true secret policeman , he relies on his circle of KGB men from St. Petersburg .
His power base shrinks by the day , and his strangling of independent information makes him increasingly ill-informed .
The consequences were apparent in the school hostage drama in Beslan in North Ossetia .
It possessed no relevant intelligence .
Policemen accepted bribes to let the terrorists though .
Russia 's best special forces were sent to Beslan , but they were not given ammunition , body armor , battle plans , or operative command .
The school was never cordoned off .
In the end , local Ossetians stormed the school with their own guns and killed several special troops in contempt .
Incredibly , the Chairman of the Federal Security Service -LRB- FSB -RRB- and the Minister of Interior arrived in Beslan soon after the siege started , but hid doing nothing .
Similarly , the two regional governors concerned refused to go to Beslan .
In fact , nobody from the government did anything .
Putin and his government simply ignored the Beslan crisis , minimizing news coverage about it .
Official statements came from a junior local official , who made himself a fool through gross lies . Obviously , such secrecy hurts Russia .
It is difficult to imagine a worse government performance .
In his time , Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev was ridiculed for only being interested in concealing bad news and not wanting to remedy problems .
The conclusions from the Beslan drama are obvious .
Chechen policy must be revisited .
The security forces should be cleansed and disciplined .
Impotent ministers and governors should be sacked , while their offices should be given more authority .
More open information flows and fewer KGB appointees are needed .
Putin , however , wants nothing of the kind .
He does not obey the elementary rule that when in a hole , you stop digging .
None of the culprits has been sacked , while the editor of Izvestiya was sacked as a punishment for accurate reporting .
Nothing is done against the rampant corruption of the FSB .
Rather than give governors more authority , he demanded to appoint them himself .
Instead of strengthening the government , he deprived it of his one of his best men , Dmitri Kozak , and appointed another unknown KGB man from St. Petersburg in his place . This is all harm and no cure .
Putin 's rule is not only authoritarian ; it is dysfunctional .
It is too rigid and centralized to handle crises .
Rather than address actual problems , Putin pursues his personal authoritarian agenda .
This centralized police state is interested in little but its own economic and political power .
It is difficult to escape the impression that Putin is more interested in pampering his KGB men than fighting terrorism .
Because liberal economic reforms harm their interests , such reforms have been abandoned .
Ordinary Russians are not blind .
They ask : `` How can the appointment of governors be a means of fighting terrorism ? ''
Putin is swiftly eroding the great authority he built up during his first term .
This process can destabilize Russia faster than anybody now realizes .
The question is no longer whether Putin will really leave office when his term ends in 2008 , but whether he will be able to save himself that long .
He can probably do so , but will need to undertake a complete U-turn . He must sack his top KGB friends and hapless Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov .
A return to democracy , regional self-government and free media are other requirements .
He must also settle the Yukos affair and change his Chechen policy .
Putin has the power to do so , but hardly the mindset .
The Orange Velvet Revolution
The Orange Velvet Revolution
Ukraine 's ` Orange Revolution ' will reach its climax on December 26 , when Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich and former Prime Minister Viktor Yushchenko will replay their run-off for the presidency . The massive fraud that was supposed to bring victory to Mr Yanukovich , and which incited hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians to take to the streets of Kyiv to defent their rights , no longer looks possible .
Ukraine is undergoing a true liberal revolution , akin to the great European liberal revolutions of 1848 , and reminiscent of Prague 's Velvet revolution of 1989 .
Ukrainians demand democracy , freedom and the rule of law .
After five years of an average annual economic growth of 9 % , economic claims are strikingly absent , as are all socialist and even social demands .
The discredited election results suggested that the country is geographically and ethnically divided , with the democratic opposition candidate Yushchenko winning overwhelmingly in seventeen western and central regions , while Yanukovich dominated in ten eastern and southern regions .
However , Yushchenko did carry several Russian-speaking regions , notably the capital Kiev , and Yanukovich won most in the authoritarian Donetsk and Luhansk regions furthest to the east .
Much of the regional differences can be explained by their degree of democracy and openness rather than ethnicity .
Wisely , Yushchenko launched the slogan `` East and West together ! '' emphasizing his endeavor to unite the country .
Similarly , miners bussed by their managers to Kiev were soon being convinced of the ` Orange ' cause by the demonstrators and were quickly sent back East by their minders .
The role of business is palpable on both sides .
A quip says this is a revolt of the millionaires against the billionaires .
The Yanukovich candidacy was supported by the three dominant business clans with rather few allies , while the business community , and even some billionaires , overwhelmingly supported Yushchenko .
This is a truly bourgeois revolution .
Both the Ukrainian revolution and high economic growth have been caused by President Leonid Kuchma 's patent habit of playing everybody against everybody , while abstaining from fair play .
Ordinary Ukrainians aspire to law and order ; businessmen want their playing field to be leveled with the richest and most well connected .
Yushchenko is careful not to criticize oligarchs but `` bandits '' and corruption , because smaller oligarchs support him .
Rarely has one country intervened so heavily in another country 's elections as Russia did here .
Yushchenko 's campaign alleges that Russian enterprises were forced by the Kremlin to put up $ 300 million for the Yanukovich campaign .
Kyiv and its airwaves were flooded with Russian political advisors , slandering Yushchenko worse than any Ukrainian did .
President Putin himself campaigned twice for Yanukovich in Ukraine and congratulated him twice before the forged final results had been presented , rendering him little but ridiculous .
Russia 's extreme activism is curious .
Yanukovich stands for a truly oligarchic state of the sort Putin defeated at home , and Yanukovich accused Yushchenko of having sold Ukrainian companies to Russian corporations .
President Putin 's behavior is probably best explained by his dislike for democracy .
In addition , if Ukraine 's President becomes an international pariah , he can only turn to Russia , as is the case of President Aleksandr Lukashenko in Belarus .
After this spectacular Russian failure , however , Putin 's `` managed democracy '' looks anachronistic and faces the threat of a real democracy in its neighbor spreading to Russia .
For the first time , Ukrainians have thrown their little-brother complex toward the Russians overboard .
With new self-confidence , they note that they are thinking and facing the truth unlike their Russian brethren .
Ukraine has little choice but to turn to Europe and the West .
Ukrainian exports of steel have boomed on China 's appetite , but sooner or later that appetite will be sated , and Ukrainian steel producers will need new markets .
Europe is the obvious choice , while Russia has little but stiff competition to offer .
If Ukraine becomes a democracy , it will undoubtedly soon develop the rule of law .
It is already a market economy and it is certainly located in Europe .
Yet much can still go wrong .
The most obvious risk is that the elections are not concluded or that Yushchenko is denied executive power .
Solidarity suffered that frustration in Poland in 1980-81 , which prolonged communist rule for a decade .
Fortunately for Ukraine , its business is private , and a common view of the whole business community is that the electoral rerun must be conclusive .
Another danger lies in the prominent role in the revolution of multi-millionaires .
No doubt they want to dominate the new cabinet , and with their impressive executive and intellectual skills they are dispersed over all parties .
Alas , if they are allowed to run the show , Ukraine might face more redistribution of fortunes than cleansing of corruption , letting the revolutionary public down .
Ideally , Yushchenko should reach out to the new professionals who have not as yet been intoxicated by the pervasive corruption of the old administration .
Nor has the old regime disappeared .
Yushchenko has gained a majority in Parliament because many adherents of the old regime switched their allegiance out of convenience .
Ukraine needs early parliamentary elections , but that is constitutionally difficult to accomplish .
Meanwhile , Yushchenko was forced to accept a poorly designed political reform full of traps .
The Russian threat lingers , whereas the West is more likely than not to be too passive .
Fortunately , Yushchenko 's camp is painfully aware that time is short and that they must act fast .
Ukraine has a great opportunity , but its leaders must act radically to exploit it .
Lucky Putin , Unlucky Yeltsin
Lucky Putin , Unlucky Yeltsin Russian President Vladimir Putin 's assertive foreign policy stance of recent years reflects the confidence that comes with a booming economy .
In 1999 , the year before Putin succeeded Boris Yeltsin as president , Russia 's GDP was a paltry $ 200 billion .
By last year , it had reached $ 1 trillion .
Real growth has averaged 7 % for eight years , and real incomes have grown by roughly 10 % per year .
Russia 's budget surplus has stood at more than 7 % of GDP in the last two years , public debt has dwindled to only 8 % of GDP , from 100 % in 1999 , and the current account surplus has averaged at 10 % of GDP for the last eight years .
But Russia 's stellar economic performance has little to do with Putin 's policy , and a lot to do with the reforms Yeltsin embraced .
By 1998 , Russia already had achieved a critical mass of markets and private enterprise , while the financial crash of that year worked like a catharsis , forcing the government to abolish enterprise subsidies that underpinned a devastating budget deficit of some 9 % of GDP .
Moreover , world oil prices that had fallen to $ 10 a barrel started rising toward the stratosphere .
The whole success story thus was in place in early 1999 , one year before Putin entered the stage .
To be sure , Putin should be praised for substantial economic reforms during his first three years .
A new tax code was adopted , with lower and fewer taxes , notably a flat income tax of 13 % .
The civil code was completed , a new customs code was enacted , and substantial judicial reform was implemented .
At the same time , however , Putin has systematically eliminated the rudimentary democracy Yeltsin had build .
One television channel after another was taken over by the state under various pretexts , as were major newspapers .
Opposition candidates and parties were denied registration for the slightest formal complaint .
Falsification of elections became the rule .
Many prominent Russians favored the Pinochet model of authoritarian politics and liberal economics .
In fact , since 2003 , Putin 's main economic policy has been re-nationalization .
Well-run private companies have been more or less forced to sell out to state-dominated companies .
Gazprom is buying up oil -LRB- Sibneft -RRB- , gas , and power companies at knockdown prices , reinforcing its monopoly .
That , in turn , allows Gazprom to boost its profitability through price increases , despite stagnant production .
Indeed , with state companies now producing one-third of Russia 's oil , output growth has plummeted , as owners of private enterprises -- the source of dynamism in the sector -- are now afraid to invest in new capacity .
Among foreign investors , both Shell and TNK-BP are being pushed out by Gazprom in their main gas fields in Russia .
Beyond oil and gas , Russia 's arms export agency , Rosoboronexport , has just seized Avtovaz , the giant dysfunctional Soviet car factory , and VSMPO-Avisma , Russia 's big titanium company , while all aircraft production has been concentrated in one state company .
The government cheers this re-nationalization , although it has reduced Russia 's industrial growth from 8.3 % in 2004 to 4 % in the last two years .
Similarly , inefficient state banks -- far inferior to private banks even in Kazakhstan or Ukraine -- dominate the banking system .
The not very profitable state-owned Vneshtorgbank , for example , is on a buying spree , aggravating the quality of Russian banking .
Increasingly , Russia 's oil surpluses drive economic growth through rising investment , which boosts construction and consumption , in turn benefiting retail trade and finance .
With personal incomes rising strongly , poverty is declining , while 68 % of Russia 's college-age youth now attend universities .
But other social indicators are unimpressive .
Life expectancy for men is stuck at 59 .
The murder rate is even higher under Putin than it was under Yeltsin , as is the traffic death rate .
None of the big public systems -- education , health care , or the military -- has been reformed , and the regime shows little interest in doing so .
Instead , the Kremlin is preoccupied with the profitability and value of the state-dominated companies that it controls .
Not surprisingly , all corruption indicators have been rising since Putin took over from Yeltsin , whereas they are falling in most post-communist countries .
Although corruption is pervasive , no top official has been prosecuted .
Putin and his KGB friends from St. Petersburg sit safely on all this wealth , thanks to their authoritarian governance and control over all security organs .
Such a powerful apparatus can not retire to a quiet life in a dacha as Yeltsin did -- it would have to privatize everything first -- which implies that Putin has no choice but to remain in office , regardless of what he says about not seeking a third presidential term .
But if he holds on to power contrary to the constitution , his popularity could easily collapse , especially as his economic policy has thrived on luck , not reform .
Putin 's Last Stand
Putin 's Last Stand WASHINGTON -- On April 2-4 , NATO will hold its biggest summit ever in Bucharest , the capital of its new member , Romania .
Incredibly , NATO has invited its fiercest critic , Russian President Vladimir Putin , to attend . For the first time since 2002 , he will .
His presence is an embarrassment to NATO , but an even greater disgrace for Russia .
The two biggest issues in Bucharest will be whether to invite Albania , Croatia , and Macedonia to join NATO , and whether to offer applications to Ukraine and Georgia to start so-called `` membership action plans . ''
These questions should be decided by NATO 's members , not outsiders .
So Putin 's views about NATO are clear .
He will scandalize the summit by seeking to intimidate the former Soviet clients in the room .
Such an aggressive attitude benefits a country 's foreign policy only up to a point -- one that Putin passed long ago .
Initially , he acted as an able diplomat and accommodator , but since his Munich speech , Putin has begun uniting the West against Russia .
In his speech on May 9 , 2007 , commemorating Russia 's victory in World War II , Putin compared the United States with Nazi Germany : `` We have a duty to remember that the causes of any war lie above all in the mistakes and miscalculations of peacetime , and that these causes have their roots in an ideology of confrontation and extremism .
It is all the more important that we remember this today , because these threats are not becoming fewer , but are only transforming and changing their appearance .
These new threats , just as under the Third Reich , show the same contempt for human life and the same aspiration to establish an exclusive dictate over the world . ''
Serious politicians do not speak like that .
These are the rants of Putin 's few remaining friends -- Venezuela 's Hugo Chavez , Iran 's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , and Belarus 's Alyaksandr Lukashenka .
At home , awareness is rising that Putin is damaging Russia 's interests by insulting and intimidating everybody .
He is isolating his country among the world 's pariahs ; worse yet , he has achieved little .
When Putin became president in 2000 , he named accession to the World Trade Organization as his foreign policy priority .
He failed , because he gave in to petty protectionist interests , imposing a timber embargo against Finland and Sweden , a fish embargo against Norway , and various agricultural embargos against Lithuania , Ukraine , Moldova , Georgia , and others .
Russia 's foreign policy is focused on the interests of its state-dominated corporations , notably Gazprom , which has concluded agreements with many foreign countries and companies for monopolistic deliveries .
But a Gazprom pipeline typically costs three times as much per kilometer as a similar Western pipeline , because of `` leakage '' -LRB- kickbacks and waste -RRB- .
The primary purpose of Russia 's foreign policy seems to be to tap Russia 's state companies for the benefit of Kremlin officials .
But customers do not trust suppliers who cut deliveries , raise prices unpredictably , expropriate competitors , and let production decrease in the way Gazprom and Russia 's other state companies have done .
As a result , Russia 's gas exports to Europe have started declining .
Putin 's foreign policy also is evidently intended to whip up populist chauvinism .
Beating up on foreigners may boost his authoritarian rule , but this , too , has a price .
Not only the US and Europe , but all former Soviet republics feel alienated by Putin 's aggressive tactics .
Many are seeking to shield themselves from Russia 's capricious embargos -- for example , by seeking alternative energy supplies .
Arguably , Russia has improved its relations with China under Putin , but at the cost of acceding to China 's demands for two big disputed islands over which the two countries fought in 1969 .
Putin 's apparent aim was to secure financing for Rosneft 's purchase of the Yugansk oil field , which was part of the Yukos confiscation .
Yet China , too , is wary of Putin , and has been sending warm signals to leaders of former Soviet republics , such as Ukraine 's Yuliya Tymoshenko .
True , armaments costs have risen sharply , but only because Putin 's KGB friends , who monopolize weapons production , have stolen inordinate amounts .
Yet , despite this spending shortfall , Putin seems obsessed with making pointless and provocative gestures , such as resuming long-range nuclear bomber flights off the American coast .
In the early 1990 's , many westerners and Russians wanted Russia to become a full-fledged member of both the European Union and NATO , on the condition that Russia became a full-fledged democracy .
Unfortunately , the West never made that offer , and Russian democracy went astray .
Russia should be given a new chance , but only after Putin has departed .
Russia is no enemy of the West ; Vladimir Putin is .
Ukraine 's Dollar Addiction
Ukraine 's Dollar Addiction KYIV -- Inflation in Ukraine is skyrocketing .
By March , it reached 26 % per year and continues to rise .
Although prices are increasing around the world , Ukraine 's inflation is extreme , twice as much as in neighboring Russia .
Amazingly , instead of dampening inflation , Ukraine 's central bank is stoking it .
Ukraine 's prices started spiraling out of control around the time when Yuliya Tymoshenko returned as prime minister last December .
Malicious observers suggest that she is to blame for pursuing populist social expenditures . But this is false .
Her government actually tightened the budget just before New Year .
Indeed , Finance Minister Viktor Pynzenyk reports that the state recorded a budget surplus of 0.6 % of GDP during the first quarter of 2008 .
This is not surprising , because state revenues expand with rising prices , while expenditures are largely fixed .
But Tymoshenko 's government has , in reality , done a solid fiscal job .
State finances are generally in good shape , with public debt at just 11 % of GDP .
According to the National Bank of Ukraine -LRB- NBU -RRB- , international reserves have grown steadily and now stand at $ 33 billion .
The real cause of Ukraine 's inflation is that its currency , the hryvnia , remains pegged to the US dollar .
When the dollar falls in value , as it has , Ukraine 's very open economy imports inflation .
In the last year , the dollar 's value dropped by 12 % against the euro , which is a more important currency than the dollar in Ukraine 's foreign trade .
The International Monetary Fund has persistently warned Ukraine that its dollar peg could cause a financial crisis because of over - or undervaluation , and for years has called on Ukraine to free its exchange rate .
But the NBU refused to do so -- making Ukraine the last country in Central and Eastern Europe to tie its currency to the dollar .
Ukraine 's powerful industrialists praised the NBU 's low exchange-rate policy , believing it makes the country more competitive .
They ignore the fact that the NBU can control only the nominal appreciation of the hryvnia .
But costs are determined by the real revaluation , which is the sum of exchange-rate changes and inflation .
The dollar peg has also forced the NBU to pursue a loose monetary policy .
Ukraine 's current refinance rate is 16 % a year , 10 % less than inflation , which means that Ukraine has a negative real interest rate of 10 % a year .
As a result , Ukraine 's money supply , M3 , exploded by no less than 52 % in the last year , which points to inflation hitting 30 % soon .
The NBU 's leadership understands that it must act to contain inflation , but its insistence on the dollar peg ties their hands , because it prevents them from raising interest rates sufficiently .
Instead , they have reverted to strict reserve requirements , effectively rationing credit and thereby causing a domestic credit squeeze in the midst of the current international financial crisis , which is likely to force some medium-sized banks into bankruptcy because of liquidity problems .
Rationing is always worse than a market .
Why does the NBU persist with this harmful policy ?
Incompetence is one reason , but politics is probably the decisive cause .
The NBU is subordinate to President Viktor Yushchenko , who , despite naming Tymoshenko as prime minister , seems more interested in harming her politically than in capping inflation .
The flaws in the NBU 's policy are so obvious it will be forced to free the exchange rate , but it might act too late .
Even now , in the midst of an inflationary crisis , the NBU wants to move in small steps , evidently failing to grasp the severity of the crisis .
The NBU needs to announce that it no longer has an exchange-rate target and that it will stop intervening by ending its purchases of dollars on the currency market .
If the NBU lets the exchange rate float , Ukrainians are likely to exchange billions of dollars into hryvnia , driving up the hryvnia exchange rate .
That would contain Ukraine 's inflation , as the NBU could restrict the money supply through high interest rates rather than rationing .
Time is short .
The great economist Rudi Dornbusch used to say that a financial crisis usually starts much later than anyone expects , but then develops faster than anyone can imagine .
Ukraine is on the financial precipice .
Yushchenko and the NBU can still act , but if they do not do so immediately , a costly and unnecessary financial crisis might ensue .
As prime minister , Yushchenko saved his country from financial default in early 2000 .
Ukraine 's well-being must not be sacrificed to his political ambitions .
Russia 's Coming Financial Crash
Russia 's Coming Financial Crash WASHINGTON , DC -- Today , the whole world is being hit by a tremendous financial crisis , but Russia is facing a perfect storm .
The Russian stock market is in free fall , plummeting by 60 % since May 19 , a loss of $ 900 billion .
And the plunge is accelerating .
As a result , Russia 's economic growth is likely to fall sharply and suddenly .
One problem is that , after a long period of fiscal prudence , Russia 's government has shown extraordinary ineptitude .
Russia has enjoyed average annual economic growth of 7 % since 1999 . With huge current-account and budget surpluses , it had accumulated international reserves of $ 600 billion by July .
The initial American financial crisis barely touched Russia , but the global economic slowdown brought about a decline in oil and other commodity prices by more than one-third since July , which was a big blow .
All the other hits , however , have been self-inflicted .
On July 24 , Prime Minister Vladimir Putin initiated the first act by fiercely attacking , without evidence , the timid owner of the giant coal and steel company Mechel for price-gouging and tax evasion .
In three days , Mechel 's shares lost half their value , triggering the Russian stock market 's decline .
Then , on August 8 , Putin launched the second act of this Russian tragedy , his long-planned attack on Georgia .
Shockingly , Russia argued that it had the right to attack a country that harbored people to whom it had just issued passports , scaring all countries with Russian minorities .
By recognizing the `` independence '' of the two occupied territories , Abkhazia and South Ossetia , Russia turned the whole world against it .
Russia 's leaders have earned a reputation for being unreliable , quixotic , and unpredictable , but markets like trustworthiness , stability , and predictability .
Not surprisingly , foreign investors no longer favor Putin 's Russia .
Within a week of its attack on Georgia , Russia recorded a capital outflow of $ 16 billion , which has since increased to $ 30 billion .
This is a small sum relative to Russia 's currency reserves , but plenty for the underdeveloped banking system , which experienced a severe credit squeeze .
Putin continues to deny that Russia 's financial problems were caused by his war in Georgia , and it took the Central Bank more than a month to provide substantial liquidity injections .
But it was already too late , as the liquidity problem had become a matter of solidity .
Overtly , Russian stock valuations look attractive , but by heaping abuse on foreigners , Putin has scared them away , while Russian investors have no money at hand .
With every statement , Putin erodes Russia 's political risk profile .
As is customary , many Russian businessmen pledged their shares to borrow money for stock purchases .
As the stock market dives , they receive margin calls and are being forced to sell their shares at ever-lower prices , causing the stock market 's downward spiral to accelerate .
In Soviet fashion , the Moscow stock exchanges closed for four days in a row in the week of September 15 , because stocks plunged too fast .
By denying the problem , the authorities have aggravated the lack of confidence .
On international financial markets , the war in Georgia has rendered Russian debt and bonds toxic .
Interest rates on Russia 's bonds have risen by 2-3 percentage points , and many Russian creditors no longer have access to international capital markets .
Russia is just about to enter the third act of this tragedy , a banking crisis .
Numerous medium-sized banks , and some large ones , are set to go under in the stock-market turmoil .
Too many big investors can no longer meet their margin calls , while borrowing costs have risen sharply .
The recent appreciation of the dollar adds to their hardship .
In the fourth act , the real estate bubble will burst .
A reasonable guess would be that Moscow 's astronomic real-estate prices will fall by at least two-thirds .
That will exacerbate the banking crisis .
In the fifth act , investment will seize up .
Why continue building when you can neither finance your investment nor sell real estate ?
Russian consumers are already scared and will cut their consumption , causing aggregate demand to contract .
In the end , real economic growth will come to a screeching halt , perhaps as early as next year .
Other factors are likely to aggravate the situation .
High-level corruption is so rampant that Russia appears unable to build major public infrastructure projects .
Oil and other commodity prices are likely to fall further , and oil and gas production have already stagnated .
Putin has turned his back on the World Trade Organization and is promoting protectionism , which will also harm growth .
Strangely , the most solid parts of the Russian financial system are the state budget and the currency reserves , but it is too late for them to prevent this tragedy . Neither arbitrary state intervention nor brutality will restore investor confidence .
The villain in this drama is Vladimir Putin , who has thrived on eight years of rapid growth generated by the market reforms of his predecessor , Boris Yeltsin .
Russia had a good chance to escape this international financial crisis , but , through his ruthlessness and ineptitude , Putin has rendered his poor country a prime victim .
How long Russia can afford such an expensive prime minister ?
The Return of the Siloviki STOCKHOLM -- Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin recently announced that Russia , Belarus , and Kazakhstan have abandoned their separate talks to join the World Trade Organization . Instead , they would seek to enter the world trade body as a single customs union .
Two days earlier , United States Trade Representative Ron Kirk and European Union Trade Commissioner Catherine Ashton had completed successful talks on Russia 's accession to the WTO with Putin 's first deputy , Igor Shuvalov , Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin , and Minister of Economy and Development Elvira Nabiullina .
As late as June 3 , Putin had declared himself sure of Russia 's `` swift joining of the WTO . ''
The leaders of Belarus or Kazakhstan seemed equally surprised by Putin 's statement , especially as Russia had just prohibited almost all imports of dairy products from Belarus in a protectionist ploy .
After 16 years of negotiations , Russia appeared poised to join the WTO within a couple of months .
Indeed , only three difficult hurdles remained .
First , Ukraine demands a bilateral protocol on market access , which would force Russia to abolish roughly 100 trade sanctions , primarily in agriculture .
The second obstacle is border controls with Georgia , a mainly political issue : whether Abkhazia and South Ossetia are independent , as Russia maintains , or are part Georgia , as the rest of the world believes .
Finally , the EU insists that Russia abolish planned prohibitive export tariffs on lumber .
Only the Georgian issue is really serious .
A customs union with Belarus and Kazakhstan is no alternative to Russia 's WTO accession .
Moreover , while the customs union was proclaimed in 1995 , the earliest it can be formed is in July 2011 , which is unlikely .
Predominantly a commodity exporter , Russia has less need for the WTO than a manufacturer like China .
Even so , one-fifth of Russia 's exports comprise metals and chemicals that are sensitive to anti-dumping measures .
A series of World Bank and Russian studies have estimated that Russia can gain 0.5-1 .0 percentage points in economic growth for half a decade if it joins the WTO .
Membership is also important for Russia 's international standing .
It is the only G-20 country outside of the WTO , which accounts for 96 % of global trade .
The WTO also represents a choice of economic and political strategy .
Before Putin resigned as president in May 2008 , he presented his `` Russia 2020 '' program .
Its heart was an `` innovation strategy '' based on more market reforms and investment in human capital , leading to annual growth of 6-7 % .
In their rhetoric , President Dmitri Medvedev and his technocrats embrace this vision .
But Putin and his siloviki -LRB- political allies whose power base is in the security apparatus -RRB- seem to prefer an `` inertia strategy , '' the worst of the Russia 2020 scenarios .
This strategy amounts to state capitalism , living on Russia 's energy wealth , and doing nothing to curtail Russia 's massive red tape and corruption .
By reversing course on the WTO , Putin has again shown himself to be Russia 's master .
He did the same thing last summer by lashing out against a successful mining and metallurgical company , Mechel , and provoking the war in Georgia .
During the winter , Putin 's poor policy choices on the financial crisis undermined his power .
Rather than shielding Russia 's private enterprises , he engineered a domestic liquidity freeze , which led to a sharp drop in GDP of 9.5 % in the first quarter of 2009 , despite Russia 's huge foreign reserves .
The pragmatic technocrats took over , but the subsequent doubling of oil prices signals that the danger for Russia 's economy is over for now , so the siloviki are resuming command .
The prominent Russian military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer insists that their prime aim is to finish off Georgia and its president , Mikheil Saakashvili , who remains in power and defiant .
Georgia has received no military support and is virtually undefended .
The Kremlin continues its propaganda offensive against Georgia , and has vetoed prolonging the mandate for United Nations observers in Georgia and Abkhazia . A major Russian military maneuver , Caucasus 2009 , is underway .
The last such maneuver , Caucasus 2008 , was followed by the invasion of Georgia .
During the latter part of this maneuver , July 6-8 , US President Barack Obama is supposed to meet President Medvedev in Moscow .
Medvedev obviously hopes to reach out and improve Russia 's and his own standing in the world .
The siloviki , however , prefer Russia isolated and authoritarian , with power securely in their hands .
The Kremlin wants a new strategic arms control agreement , but the siloviki desire nothing more .
Obama 's administration had hoped for a final breakthrough in Russia 's WTO talks , but Putin 's actions have eliminated prospects for such an outcome .
The US also wants progress on the territorial integrity of former Soviet states , such as Georgia , but that , too , is unlikely .
Putin or his collaborators seem to be setting up Medvedev for a failure , suggesting that their jealousy of Medvedev 's limited power is greater than their interest in defending Russia 's national interests .
Yet there is still hope that Putin encounters a sufficiently negative reaction that he changes his stance on WTO accession .
After all , he suspended Russia 's WTO accession talks after the August 2008 war in Georgia , only to allow them to restart this spring .
New Europe 's Surprising Resilience
KIEV -- Two years ago , five of the ten new East European members of the European Union -- the three Baltic states , Hungary , and Romania -- appeared to be devastated by the global financial crisis .
Social unrest , huge devaluations , and populist protests loomed .
And then nothing .
Today , all of these countries are returning to financial health and economic growth without significant disruption .
No country has even changed its exchange-rate regime .
Old Europe should learn from New Europe 's untold success .
The cause of the East European financial crisis was a standard credit boom-and-bust cycle .
East European countries attracted large international capital flows , owing to loose global monetary policy and accommodating business conditions .
In the end , short-term bank lending became excessive and was used to finance a splurge on real-estate investment and consumption , while inflation took hold .
Moreover , current-account deficits piled up into substantial private-sector foreign debt , while public finances were in good order everywhere but Socialist-led Hungary .
This crisis of success and overheating was reminiscent of East Asia in 1997-1998 .
East Asia 's nations , as well as Russia in 1998 and Argentina in 2001 , exited their crises through devaluation .
A choir of prominent American economists , including Paul Krugman , Kenneth Rogoff , and Nouriel Roubini , claimed that Latvia , Estonia , and Lithuania must also devalue .
None of them did , yet they raised themselves out of the crisis .
The Baltic states had many reasons not to devalue .
Their aim is to adopt the euro as soon as possible , which devaluation would have complicated .
As their small and open economies were already heavily `` euro-ized , '' the pass-though of higher foreign prices into inflation would have been huge following any devaluation , which would also have broken their otherwise reasonably healthy banking systems .
Instead , the three Baltic governments opted for `` internal devaluation , '' reducing public-sector wages and costs .
In 2009 , all three countries cut public expenditures by 8-10 % of GDP , which -- remarkably -- was politically easier than marginal cuts .
When cuts are big , people realize how severe the crisis is , and the politically impossible becomes necessary .
Small cuts are usually delivered evenly , aggravating all public services , while deep cuts have to be selective and structural .
Therefore , they may improve economic efficiency .
All the countries in crisis cut their public administration and wages .
Latvia slashed state salaries by 35 % and the number of public agencies by half .
It also closed half of its excessive number of hospitals and sacked superfluous teachers , of which there was one for every six children before the crisis .
Estonia , Lithuania , Hungary , Romania , and Bulgaria have carried out similar reforms , though not quite as radical .
-LRB- Lithuania , for example , pursued a higher-education reform to enhance efficiency and quality . -RRB-
And , though state revenues have fallen with recession , forcing a few countries to hike value-added taxes , none has increased income taxes , and none of the seven countries that had in place a flat-rate income tax has abandoned it .
As a result , these countries exit the crisis more productive .
Contrary to expectations -- and to the Greek and French experiences -- social unrest has been minimal .
Extremists on neither the right nor the left have benefited .
In the European Parliament elections in June 2009 , center-right parties won a majority in all ten eastern EU countries , and center-right parties now govern in nine of them , with Slovenia the sole exception .
The liberal right has never been stronger in Eastern Europe .
The communists have been wiped out and the socialists badly weakened .
The extreme right has lost support everywhere but Hungary .
This year , responsible center-right parties have won three surprise victories -- in the Czech Republic , Slovakia , and Latvia .
The new Czech foreign minister , Karel Schwarzenberg , stated : `` We won by telling the truth .
Populism is no longer popular . ''
Most remarkable was the victory of Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis on October 2 .
His coalition increased its share of parliamentary seats from 45 % to 63 % , although GDP fell last year by a shocking 18 % .
Dombrovskis blamed his irresponsible predecessors , and voters clearly saw him as the most credible problem solver .
Three countries in the region -- Hungary , Latvia , and Romania -- required emergency standby programs with the International Monetary Fund .
The IMF had learned from East Asia , posing fewer conditions and offering more budget financing , because the problems were temporary and not structural .
In addition , the EU provided financing , whereas the European Central Bank , which could have given swap credits , played no helpful role .
As a result of their successful crisis resolution , the EU 's East European members look better both fiscally and structurally than the old eurozone members .
Of the 12 members of the eurozone in 2001 , only two -LRB- Finland and Luxembourg -RRB- have public debts of less than 60 % of GDP to compare with nine of the ten new eastern members .
Only Hungary has a large public debt .
East Europeans suffered from high private-sector debt , which they largely avoided transforming into public debt .
All of this , together with post-crisis improvement in EU institutions -LRB- such as financial regulators -RRB- contributes to greater European convergence .
Whereas Eastern Europe 's economies look healthier than the eurozone countries , they are not abandoning the EU project .
On the contrary , this year Estonia qualified to enter the eurozone in January 2011 .
The Wobbly West
CHARLESTON , SOUTH CAROLINA -- Early in the financial crisis , a major emerging-market investor told me : `` This is not a global , but a semi-global financial crisis . '' He was right : it really was a crisis of the United States , Europe , and Japan .
Among emerging markets , only Eastern Europe was badly hit .
Indeed , the crisis marks the emerging economies ' overtaking of the major Western countries , with huge consequences for global power , finance , politics , and economics .
The eurozone sovereign-debt crisis appears to have been the worst-managed financial crisis since Argentina 's default in 2001 .
The European Union and eurozone leaders have seriously discredited themselves .
Europe requires institutional changes that are much more fundamental than anything discussed so far .
The International Monetary Fund has never bet such huge sums on a single country as it has on Greece .
As a result , the IMF , a custodian of some of the international reserves held by the world 's central banks , risks losing tens of billions of dollars .
Is this a responsible use of international taxpayers ' money ?
Would the IMF not have insisted on a much tougher program , with less financing , for any country outside the eurozone ?
The apparent explanation for the IMF 's extraordinary gamble is that the managing director who made the decision to support Greece so heavily hailed from the eurozone and , at the time , was barely disguising his ambitions to run for the French presidency -- that is , before his arrest in New York on charges of rape .
Europeans , moreover , dominate the Fund 's leadership .
It is a discomforting conflict of interest that debtors dominate an international institution that lends them vast sums .
This mismanagement should disqualify any eurozone policymaker from the IMF 's managing directorship , and yet Christine Lagarde , French finance minister , was named to succeed her compatriot Dominique Strauss-Kahn after his resignation .
Who would seriously have suggested a Russian to lead the IMF after its financial crash in 1998 , or an Argentine after its default in 2001 ?
Today , the eurozone is equally toxic .
The EU , the United States , and Japan are in fiscal jeopardy , and several countries -- Japan , Greece , Italy , and Belgium -- have public debts exceeding their GDP .
Increasingly , people recognize that loose fiscal policy was poor economic policy , with serious implications for macroeconomic thinking , politics , and constitutions .
In macroeconomic theory , Keynesianism is due for its second demise .
Milton Friedman 's monetarism delivered the first death blow in the 1980 's , but it did not generate useful policy rules or predictions .
During the crisis , prevailing macroeconomic theory counseled massive fiscal stimulus , thereby aggravating the public-debt crisis .
The question today is whether macroeconomic theory will render itself as irrelevant as the political economy of socialism , or make useful contributions to economic policy .
For the time being , elementary fiscal and monetary rules appear more appropriate .
How could people and governments accept these enormous debts and even recommend further fiscal stimulus ?
Many public expenditures and budget deficits have no justification other than populism , and the big political loser of the crisis has been European social democracy , Keynesian economics ' political counterpart .
All too often , social democracy has amounted to populism , opposing any cuts in public expenditures and even deregulation , which would have enhanced productivity .
European voters are now punishing social-democratic parties , which have become weaker than at any time since World War I. Instead , a fiscally responsible center-right alignment of political forces has taken power in all but three of the 27 EU countries .
Western democracies have prided themselves on institutional checks and balances , but obviously these mechanisms did not work during the crisis or the preceding boom .
And they have been a recipe for policy paralysis in America 's long debate about raising the ceiling on its national debt .
So , when Chinese and Russians officials attack democracy as such , old questions about democracy 's efficacy and stability are raised anew .
There is no denying that advanced democracies largely failed to preempt the financial and sovereign-debt crises , while most emerging economies pursued better economic policies .
How can modern Western democracies impose strict fiscal discipline ?
Has the independence of central banks given unelected officials license to print money ?
How can accountability be imposed ?
How can unrepresentative vested interests be contained ?
Such questions have triggered a wide-ranging constitutional debate .
After the Second World War , many European countries enshrined extensive social guarantees in their constitutions .
Now many of these guarantees will need to be thrown out .
Instead , a number of European countries are discussing the introduction of stringent fiscal rules into their constitutions , and are contemplating even more far-reaching changes .
Excessive fiscal deficits in many Western countries must be reduced .
The average public debt in the eurozone has soared to 85 % of GDP .
Some European countries can reduce their debt through continuous budget surpluses , as Bulgaria , Finland , Russia , and Sweden have done in the last decade .
Privatization of public corporations and property is another possibility .
My Petersen Institute colleague Carmen Reinhardt suspects that financial repression will be the main debt-reduction method : governments will rely on regulation and manipulation to force savers to pay down public debt through negative real returns on their bond investments .
Meanwhile , central bankers everywhere ask themselves : why keep ever-larger international reserves in two of the world 's most mismanaged currencies , the US dollar and the euro ?
However rare changes in reserve currencies have been historically , the current situation is no longer tenable ; but a switch could further destabilize the world economy .
The West 's economic mismanagement will also reduce its military power .
At present , the US accounts for half of all global military expenditures , but cuts are due .
Relative US military power is not likely to be this great ever again , and China 's military rise looks as inevitable as its economic success .
The predicament of the West remains lamentable .
Even so , some economists still advocate more fiscal stimulus .
Instead , Western leaders need to focus on fixing their state budgets in order to salvage what they can .
Westernize the Black Sea Region
Westernize the Black Sea Region
The bloody end to the schoolhouse hostage crisis in North Ossetia , and recent clashes in Georgia between government troops and separatist forces , have put the troubled Black Sea region on the front pages of newspapers once again .
This rising violence is also a wake-up call for the West , highlighting the need for a new Euro-Atlantic strategy in a vitally important region that lies at the crossroads of Europe , Eurasia , and the Middle East .
Indeed , the Black Sea region is the Euro-Atlantic community 's eastern frontier with the wider Middle East .
With Afghanistan , Iraq , and Iran topping the list of strategic challenges facing the West , anchoring democracy and security in these new borderlands of the Euro-Atlantic community has become imperative for both the United States and the EU .
Moreover , success here can provide lessons in how to facilitate the daunting process of reform and modernization in the wider Middle East .
Georgia 's `` Rose Revolution '' last winter demonstrated that the will to implement radical reform now exists .
For the first time , a country in the region is matching its aspirations with the concrete steps needed to become a viable candidate for eventual membership in Euro-Atlantic institutions .
A visitor to Georgia 's capital , Tbilisi , now sees the same level of determination to join the West that existed a decade ago in the Baltic states .
America and Europe share an interest in the success of these efforts , particularly as they seek to diversify energy supplies away from Saudi Arabian and Persian Gulf oil .
The Black Sea is poised to become a key conduit for non-OPEC , non-Gulf oil and natural gas flowing into European markets and beyond .
The Black Sea region 's long-term stability and integration with the West is thus critically important to the long-term energy security strategy of EU and NATO members .
Anchoring these countries to the West will not be easy .
Whether the end result is better relations or full integration of these countries into the EU and NATO is an open question .
But both organizations need to reach out to these countries , a process that should be seen as the next phase in completing the wider Europe .
What should a new bold yet realistic EU and NATO outreach strategy for the Black Sea region look like ?
Clearly , the region 's countries are weaker and further behind previous candidates for Western integration .
But the good news is that the EU and NATO are much better positioned to develop an ambitious strategy than they were vis-à-vis Central and Eastern Europe a decade ago .
If the EU and NATO decide to launch a bold outreach strategy for the region , they will be able to draw on existing tools , conceptual talent , and practical experience .
For example , NATO already has three members - Bulgaria , Romania , and Turkey - bordering the Black Sea .
As for the EU , the candidacies of Romania and Bulgaria need to be concluded successfully , together with the issue of Turkey 's membership aspirations .
The EU also needs to put meat on the bones of its new Neighborhood Policy , while NATO must apply new mechanisms for strengthening ties with the region .
As opposed to a 100 - or 200-meter sprint , both organizations need to think more in terms of a much longer race , perhaps a marathon .
If countries in the region embrace the idea , a network of current EU and NATO members could step forward with projects and assistance aimed at promoting a Black Sea identity and community .
Recent events in Georgia remind us that resolving the region 's `` frozen conflicts '' - i.e. , those in the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia , of Transdneistria in Moldova , and Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan - must be a priority .
In reality , these conflicts are not frozen ; they are festering wounds that breed corruption and organized crime .
They inhibit democratization and incite instability .
While these conflicts involve historical grievances , outside actors - particularly Russia - contribute to their lack of resolution , which is essential for successful reform .
So far , neither America nor Europe has made these conflicts a top priority .
Resolving these semi-dormant wars requires stepped-up political involvement , economic engagement , and a willingness to provide Western peacekeeping forces and monitors if and when they are needed .
But the long-term peace and stability needed to advance economic and political reform in the region will also require either a change in Russian behavior or a reduction in Russian influence .
The experience of the last decade suggests that a policy of engaging the Kremlin intensely while protecting fundamental Western interests may be the best way to proceed .
Developing a new Euro-Atlantic strategy for the Black Sea region must start with the democracies of North America and Europe recognizing their moral and political stake in the outcome .
Projecting stability and security in these countries is the next logical step in building a Europe `` whole and free '' and securing the Euro-Atlantic community 's eastern frontier with the Middle East .
This task will be as important over the next decade as integrating Central and Eastern Europe into the West was in the 1990 's .
Europe 's Contested Neighborhood
Europe 's Contested Neighborhood BRUSSELS -- What is the most important source of disagreement today between Russia and the West ?
It is not the issues most often in the news -- Iran or Afghanistan .
It is Europe 's contested neighborhood -- the future of those countries between the eastern border of NATO and the European Union and the western border of Russia .
While the West and Russia still talk the talk of cooperative security in Europe , geopolitical competition for influence has been renewed in these regions .
Russia today openly lays claim to a sphere of interest in its borderlands -- in direct contradiction to commitments made under the Helsinki process .
It has embraced policies and a military doctrine that labels NATO a threat and justifies the right to intervene in these countries .
While packaged in smooth diplo-speak , Russian President Dmitri Medvedev 's new proposal for European security has the less-than-hidden goal of stopping and rolling back Western influence .
Rather than moving into the twenty-first century , Russia seems determined to revert to nineteenth-century strategic thinking .
With the Obama administration focused on Afghanistan and Iran , the Kremlin hopes that a West in need of its cooperation will acquiesce in its demands .
Instead , the war 's root cause was Georgia 's desire to align itself with the West and Russia 's determination to stop it .
Many diplomats would prefer to forget the Russo-Georgian war or sweep it under the rug .
But none of the underlying tensions are resolved .
There is no stable solution in sight for Abkhazia and South Ossetia .
Russia has not abandoned the goal of breaking Georgia 's desire to go West .
Instability and separatism are growing in the northern Caucasus , making the broader region more volatile .
In late January , the Obama administration issued its first unequivocal reaffirmation of the strategy of democratic enlargement that has guided Western thinking since the collapse of the Iron Curtain two decades ago .
Speaking in Paris , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reminded us that NATO and EU enlargement created an unprecedented degree of stability and security in the eastern half of the continent , that Russia too had benefited from this stability , and that it was critical that Europe 's doors remain open to further enlargement .
Clinton went on to reject as unnecessary Medvedev 's call to re-make current European security arrangements .
NATO has also finally started engaging in defense planning and other forms of strategic reassurance for its allies in Central and Eastern Europe , which are unsettled by Russia 's new assertiveness .
But what about those countries in between -- countries like Ukraine and Georgia and the southern Caucasus ?
Ukraine has just elected as its president Viktor Yanukovich , who is unlikely to pursue a NATO integration agenda , and if follows through on his commitment to join a customs union with Russia , Belarus , and Kazakhstan , membership in the EU would be precluded .
But that does not mean that tensions with Russia will automatically disappear .
Yanukovich 's victory notwithstanding , Ukraine is a country that is becoming more European and gradually moving out of Russia 's orbit in its own chaotic way .
Regardless of whether Georgians like or dislike Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvilli , they want to go West , too .
So Russia 's attempts to bring these countries to heel are likely to continue and remain a bone of contention and conflict .
And what is Western policy ?
In reality , the West today no longer has a grand strategy toward the East .
The moral and strategic vision of the 1990 's has exhausted itself and come to a grinding halt after the shock of the Russo-Georgian war and the recent Ukrainian election .
As welcome as Clinton 's recent clear words were on the need to defend the right of countries to decide their own fate , you do n't have to go very far in Europe to hear whispers that some kind of new `` Finlandization '' might be a reasonable compromise for countries like Ukraine and Georgia .
It is time for the West to openly debate what its strategy is -- and what it is not .
Two decades ago , the West rejected `` spheres of influence , '' because Europe 's bloody history taught us that compelling nations to align themselves with others against their will was wrong and a recipe for future conflict .
If we still believe that today , we need an updated moral and strategic vision for such countries , and to back it up with a real strategy .
We need to be clear that Moscow has a right to security , but that it does not have the right to interfere in the affairs of its neighbors , to topple their governments , or to deny them their own foreign-policy aspirations .
Barack Obama is right to try to reset relations with the Kremlin and engage a revisionist Russia .
As the United States and Russia close in on a new arms-control treaty , it is time to face the question of how we deal with Europe 's contested neighborhood .
Is Syria the Next Domino ?
LONDON -- With the Tunisian and Egyptian regimes gone and street protests roiling cities from Algiers to Tehran , many people are now wondering which domino might fall next .
Syria , whose secular , militarized dictatorship most closely resembles the fallen regimes of Tunisia and Egypt , may not be next in line , but appears nonetheless to be approaching a tipping point .
Of course , the old `` domino theory '' in international relations was only a crude way of emphasizing that different parts of any region are linked to each other .
For today 's Arab world , a better metaphor might be a chessboard , from which the removal of even a pawn inevitably alters the relationships among all the other pieces .
Today , as protests mount and multiply , the government of every Arab state in the Middle East and North Africa probably believes that , if left to its own devices , it can contain internal dissent .
In Syria , it seems inevitable that protest may soon crack the regime 's brittle political immobility .
Most ordinary Syrians face extremely difficult economic and social conditions , including high unemployment , rising food prices , constraints on personal freedom , and endemic corruption .
These factors are no different from those that brought people on to the streets in North Africa and the Middle East .
What began as protests over living conditions became full-scale demands for freedom and democracy .
The best way to avoid a confrontation between the people and the security forces is a process of genuine reform leading to elections and a government of national unity .
The ingrained inertia of the current regime , however , seems to preclude any early move toward that .
Instead , Syria 's rulers are offering inducements to ensure that key constituencies remain in line -- laptops for teachers , subsidies for public-sector workers , and empty reformist rhetoric .
But the current situation calls for far more serious measures .
Lifting the state of emergency that has been in force since 1963 -- giving sweeping powers to the regime and its security services -- would be both a symbolic and tangible step in the right direction .
Unless Syria 's rulers , like other leaders in the Arab world , begin to appreciate that freedom is a fundamental human right , even the most quiescent people 's patience may wear dangerously thin .
High food prices may have served as a trigger in North Africa , but the speed with which the protesters turned their attention to political reform caught everyone off guard .
Putting this genie back in its bottle would be virtually impossible without bloodshed of the type we are now witnessing in some parts of the Arab world .
So the Syrian leadership knows that it must respond -- hence the half-hearted reform agenda that it recently outlined .
But trying to address deep-rooted popular grievances with flowery language and a bouquet of subsidies is like trying to extinguish a forest fire with a water pistol .
The solutions to Syria 's problems must be as substantive as the problems are serious .
Until now , Syria 's rulers have relied on their anti-Israel , anti-Western rhetoric to protect themselves .
But cries about the Israel-Palestine conflict were rarely heard in the protests in Tunis and Cairo .
Furthermore , in the last few years , when Israeli planes struck targets in Syria , there was no answer from the regime -- and still none when Israeli planes flew over the presidential palace .
The regime claims that it is part of the ` resistance ' with its senior partner Iran .
However the WikiLeaks cables show that the Syrian leadership told the Iranian regime not to count on it in any war with Israel because it is too weak .
So the regime is making a fatal error if it thinks that its old diversionary tactics will continue to provide it with immunity .
On the contrary , with a young , well-educated population unable to find suitable work , the regime has created its own cadre of potential protestors , who are aware that it is using empty slogans to keep the state of emergency and stay in power .
The Syrian people are strong , patient , resilient , and resourceful .
Family and social bonds remain potent in the face of adversity .
When food is scarce , people share .
When the regime cracks down on the Internet , people use proxy servers .
But they should not have to make do .
They should not have to risk their safety when they seek to engage with the world online .
No one wants to see the streets of Damascus consumed in protest , or a violent confrontation erupt between protesters and security forces .
What the Syrian people want is a meaningful dialogue with the regime .
The regime must appreciate that , despite its best efforts , Syrians have been watching events in the region with as much interest as the rest of the world .
Syria 's people may have no predilection for violence , but the birth of freedom , once witnessed , is not easily forgotten -- or trumped by state handouts and vacuous statements by a distant , self-isolated leadership .
People said the Berlin Wall would not fall .
They said that Mubarak would not stand down .
And still some say that Syria can not change .
But Syria will change , and I , like my compatriots , pray that when change comes , it is peaceful and harmonious .
The Struggle for Syria
CAIRO -- As the violence in Syria mounts , the international community 's paralysis has become increasingly jarring .
But the role of external regional forces is almost as important in fueling the domestic bloodshed as what is happening internally .
If Syria could break free of the negative influences of regional politics , genuine change without continued violence might become possible .
Syria needs to manage its diverse ethnic and religious composition , and to decide its own position on the Arab-Israeli conflict .
But that is more difficult when neighboring countries are exploiting the country 's heterogeneous makeup to pursue their own hegemonic agendas .
To the east looms Iran , with its anti-American , anti-Western rhetoric and vast regional ambitions .
To the south sits Saudi Arabia , with its long friendship with the United States and its inherent hostility toward Iran 's Islamic Republic .
And to the north is Turkey , a pro-European , largely secular and democratic country that seeks to wield influence across the Arab world .
The region in and around Syria is also populated by extremist Islamist groups that are attempting to expand their spheres of influence - and that are quick to capitalize on instability in any country .
Syria is particularly vulnerable in this regard , as extremists incite violence against minority religious groups by using , for example , television stations in Saudi Arabia and Egypt .
The current regime in Syria , in its ruthless quest to remain in power , refuses to acknowledge peaceful protesters ' demands for freedom and dignity .
If it did - and if it met those demands - Islamists would not be able to hijack the demonstrations .
Peaceful change in Syria can nonetheless be achieved , and the international community can influence that process by recognizing that its continued focus on the country 's `` complexity '' does nothing for its people .
In fact , the obsession with Syria 's sectarian rivalries provides destabilizing external forces with the oxygen that their inflammatory rhetoric requires .
The incitement against Syrian religious minorities promulgated by extremist TV stations , and by people like the Chief Justice of Saudi Arabia 's Supreme Judicial Council , coupled with equally damaging behavior by Iran , if left unchecked , could result in an even worse bloodbath , with Syria 's people drawn into a war of all against all .
The international community allowed change in Tunisia and Egypt to proceed at those countries ' own pace .
In Syria , a Libyan-style military intervention is not warranted , but diplomatic intervention is needed to allow the country 's people to determine its future .
The international community 's goal must be to persuade neighboring countries to halt their brazen , unwarranted attacks on parts of Syrian society .
In particular , the US , which has significant influence in Saudi Arabia , must act to stop attacks by that country 's extremists on Syria 's religious minorities - attacks motivated merely by a desire to provoke sectarian conflict .
Likewise , efforts to weaken Iran 's disruptive influence in the region must be maintained , while Turkey 's regional ambitions must be kept in mind .
Optimism about the Syrian people 's future must be tempered by realism about the challenges facing Syria 's opposition movement and the international community alike .
Dramatic , rapid change could result in prolonged failure .
Fortunately , Syrians have no predilection for violence .
For them , peaceful , gradual change is the best option .
And that requires a national dialogue , overseen by the international community , aimed at bolstering internal unity -- and thus at protecting the country from regional interference .
The situation in Syria is usually -- and rightly -- described as an intricate , multi-dimensional playing field with a wide variety of political actors and competing interests .
But there has been an inadequate focus on the Syrian people 's simple desire for genuine reform , greater personal freedom , and more economic opportunity .
Syrians have experienced uninterrupted dictatorship for 40 years , and , with it , extreme economic hardship , including high unemployment , rising food prices , and endemic corruption .
They are also now suffering from water shortages and a budget deficit that has been exacerbated by declining oil revenues .
But Syrians are a remarkably resilient , resourceful people , as well as being young and well educated
With international assistance in developing Syria 's democratic institutions and political infrastructure , we can build a robust civil society that can assert its own identity and sovereignty , independent of undue outside influence .
A new Syria , based on democratic principles , would not only benefit Syrians , but would be a force for stability throughout the region .
A Global Green New Deal
A Global Green New Deal NAIROBI -- With unemployment soaring , bankruptcies climbing , and stock markets in free-fall , it may at first glance seem sensible to ditch the fight against climate change and put environmental investments on hold .
But this would be a devastating mistake of immediate , as well as inter-generational , proportions .
Far from burdening an already over-stressed , over-stretched global economy , environmental investments are exactly what is needed to get people back to work , get order books flowing , and assist in powering economies back to health .
A big slice of President Barack Obama 's $ 825 billion stimulus package for the United States includes a boost to renewable energy , `` weatherizing '' a million homes , and upgrading the country 's inefficient electricity grid .
Such investments could generate an estimated five million `` green-collar '' jobs , provide a shot in the arm for the construction and engineering industries , and get America back into the equally serious business of combating climate change and achieving energy security .
The Republic of Korea , which is losing jobs for the first time in more than five years , has also spotted the green lining to grim economic times .
Other elements of Lee 's plan include construction of eco-friendly transportation networks , such as high-speed railways and hundreds of kilometers of bicycle tracks , and generating energy using waste methane from landfills . The package also counts on investments in hybrid vehicle technologies .
Similar pro-employment `` Green New Deal '' packages have been lined up in China , Japan , and the United Kingdom .
They are equally relevant to developing economies in terms of jobs , fighting poverty , and creating new opportunities at a time of increasingly uncertain commodity prices and exports .
In South Africa , the government-backed Working for Water initiative -- which employs more than 30,000 people , including women , youth , and the disabled -- also sees opportunity in crisis .
The country spends roughly $ 60 million annually fighting invasive alien plants that threaten native wildlife , water supplies , important tourism destinations , and farmland .
This work is set to expand as more than 40 million tons of invasive alien plants are harvested for power-station fuel .
As a result , an estimated 500 megawatts of electricity , equal to 2 % of the country 's electricity needs , will be generated , along with more than 5,000 jobs .
So it is clear that some countries now view environmental investments in infrastructure , energy systems , and ecosystems as among the best bets for recovery .
Others may be unsure about the potential returns from investing in ecosystem services such as forest carbon storage or in renewable energy for the 80 % of Africans who have no access to electricity .
Still others may simply be unaware of how to precisely follow suit .
In early February , the United Nations Environment Program will convene some of the world 's leading economists at the UN 's headquarters in New York .
A strategy for a Global Green New Deal , tailored to different national challenges , will be fleshed out in order to assist world leaders and ministers craft stimulus packages that work on multiple fronts .
The Global Green New Deal , which UNEP launched as a concept in October 2008 , responds to the current economic malaise .
Spent wisely , however , these stimulus packages could trigger far-reaching and transformational trends , setting the stage for a more sustainable , urgently needed Green Economy for the twenty-first century .
The trillions of dollars that have been mobilized to address current woes , together with the trillions of investors ' dollars waiting in the wings , represent an opportunity that was unthinkable only 12 months ago : the chance to steer a more resource-efficient and intelligent course that can address problems ranging from climate change and natural-resource scarcity to water shortages and biodiversity loss .
Blindly pumping the current bail-out billions into old industries and exhausted economic models will be throwing good money after bad while mortgaging our children 's future .
Instead , political leaders must use these windfalls to invest in innovation , promote sustainable businesses , and encourage new patterns of decent , long-lasting employment .
Why Cutting Carbon Emissions is not Enough
Why Cutting Carbon Emissions is not Enough Twenty years ago , governments adopted the Montreal Protocol , a treaty to protect the Earth 's ozone layer from emissions of destructive chemicals .
Few could have foreseen how far-reaching that decision would prove to be .
The Protocol explicitly aimed at phasing-out substances such as chlorofluorocarbons -LRB- CFCs -RRB- -- found in products such as refrigerators , foams , and hairsprays -- in order to repair the thin gassy-shield that filters out the sun 's harmful , ultra-violet rays .
By 2010 , close to 100 ozone-depleting substances , including CFCs , will have been phased-out globally .
Without the decisions taken 20 years ago , atmospheric levels of ozone-depleting substances would have increased ten-fold by 2050 . This could have led to up to 20 million additional cases of skin cancer and 130 million more cases of eye cataracts , not to speak of damage to human immune systems , wildlife , and agriculture .
But this is only part of the story that we celebrate on the International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone Layer -LRB- September 16 -RRB- .
Over the past two years , it has been established that the Montreal Protocol has also spared humanity a significant level of climate change , because the gases that it prohibits also contribute to global warming .
Indeed , a study in 2007 calculated the climate mitigation benefits of the ozone treaty as totalling the equivalent of 135 billion tons of CO2 since 1990 , or a delay in global warming of 7-12 years .
So the lessons learned from the Montreal Protocol may have wider significance .
Scientists now estimate that somewhere close to 50 % of climate change is being caused by gases and pollutants other than CO2 , including nitrogen compounds , low-level ozone formed by pollution , and black carbon .
Of course , a degree of scientific uncertainty about some of these pollutants ' precise contribution to warming remains .
But they certainly play a significant role .
Meanwhile , many of these gases need to be curbed because of their wider environmental impact on public health , agriculture , and the planet 's multi-trillion dollar ecosystems , including forests .
Consider black carbon , a component of the soot emissions from diesel engines and the inefficient burning of biomass cooking stoves that is linked to 1.6 million to 1.8 million premature deaths annually as a result of indoor exposure and 800,000 as a result of outdoor exposure .
Black carbon , which absorbs heat from the sun , also accounts for anywhere from 10 % to more than 45 % of the contribution to global warming , and is also linked to accelerated losses of glaciers in Asia , because the soot deposits darken , ice making it more vulnerable to melting .
One study estimates that 26 % of black carbon emissions are from stoves for heating and cooking , with more than 40 % of this amount from wood burning , roughly 20 % from coal , 19 % from crop residues , and 10 % from dung .
Some companies have developed stoves that use passive air flows , better insulation , and 60 % less wood to reduce black carbon emissions by around 70 % .
Mass introduction of such stoves could deliver multiple green-economy benefits .
While CO2 can remain in the atmosphere for centuries , other pollutants , including black carbon and ozone , remain for relatively periods -- days , weeks , months , or years -- so that reducing or ending emissions promises almost immediate climate benefits .
The international community 's over-arching concern must be to seal a serious and significant deal at the United Nations climate summit in Copenhagen in December to curtail C02 emissions and assist vulnerable countries to adapt .
If the world also is to deploy all available means to combat climate change , emissions of all substances that contribute to it must be scientifically evaluated and urgently addressed .
Fishy Conservation Efforts
NAIROBI -- If you happen to be a salamander known as the Iranian Kaiser spotted newt , chances are that things may be looking up .
Governments at the recent meeting in Doha of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species -LRB- CITES -RRB- voted for a trade ban on Iranian Kaisers , alongside tougher protection for a host of land-living creatures .
But if you are a blue-fin tuna of the western Atlantic stock , your mood will be decidedly more pessimistic .
It is a similar story for several species of shark , including the oceanic white-tip , scalloped hammerhead , and the great and spiny dogfish .
Despite strong scientific evidence showing sharp declines in the populations of all three , every proposal for tougher trade controls on these marine species -- along with more than 30 species of coral -- failed to secure the necessary two-thirds majority .
In the case of the western Atlantic stock of blue-fin tuna , several countries argued that the existing management body -- the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas -LRB- ICCAT -RRB- -- is best placed to manage the stock .
Others who proposed tougher trade rules were not convinced -- and with good reason .
Stocks of this highly prized fish have declined by up to 80 % since the dawn of industrialized fishing , and this has been on ICCAT 's watch .
In the case of sharks and rays , a recent survey indicates that close to one-third of the 64 ocean-living species are on the verge of extinction .
Their decline is linked to over-exploitation of other once-common species .
For example , spiny dogfish is partly substituting for cod in many European fish-and-chip shops .
Sharks , too , are suffering from rapidly rising demand for shark-fin soup , which is considered a delicacy in many parts of Asia .
But saving endangered and near-endangered species is not just about conservation ; it is also about defending millions of people 's livelihoods , which depend on healthy oceans .
Today 's marine environment is truly under siege .
When the explorer John Cabot sailed off the coast of Newfoundland more than 500 years ago , vast shoals of cod slowed down his ships ; crews could lower buckets over the side and fill them with fish .
By 1992 , however , over-fishing had forced the total closure of this once highly productive fishery , and , despite all efforts , Newfoundland 's Grand Banks has never recovered .
Similarly , over-fishing of sharks in the Caribbean has triggered a rise in octopus and a drastic drop in spiny lobsters and scallops -- two major sources of revenue for neighboring coastal communities .
The outcome at CITES has brought into sharp relief increasing tensions between industrial and environmental interests , as if these were diametrically opposed .
Surely a twenty-first-century fisherman does not want to see the basis of his or her living degraded and destroyed , nor does a modern conservationist want to ring-fence the environment and stop people from making a living .
So if governments want existing agreements to rule the waves , they must start acting on the sobering science and real-world numbers .
For example , with respect to sharks , existing sanctions against `` finning '' under Regional Fisheries Management Organizations should be enforced , backed up by an independent system of on-board observers to ensure that trawlers comply .
Moreover , an international action plan for sharks , including a ceiling on catches , should be created .
And proper fishing methods that catch only target species should be used , with others caught accidentally as so-called by-catch returned to the sea alive .
Where fisheries agreements are not succeeding , conservation agreements must be tried and applied .
After all , these are not competing regulatory regimes , but complimentary ones .
In the case of the western Atlantic blue-fin tuna , the ball is now firmly back in ICCAT 's court .
Governments that support the ICCAT option must now prove that it is up to the job .
They have three years to do so , before CITES next meets in Thailand .
If there is no dramatic action and improvement , governments should instead give CITES , as a well established conservation and trade agreement , a chance to reverse the species ' current plight .
Blue-fin tuna is heading for commercial , if not outright , extinction , as are a host of other economically and ecologically important marine species .
They are swimming in the last-chance lagoon .
But so , too , could be the organizations that have presided over a breathtaking collapse of so many fisheries and left a once-bountiful marine environment -- and the lives and livelihoods of many fishermen -- damaged and degraded in their wake .
A Pax Mafiosa in Mexico ?
MEXICO CITY -- The recent killing of Ignacio Coronel Villarreal , a boss of the Sinaloa drug gang , by Mexican special forces is but the latest high profile killing in an increasingly violent campaign . But is a strategy of killing off Mexico 's drug kingpins really viable ?
Mexico 's government has several options for ending the violence of narcotics-related organized crime that is devastating the country and corrupting and weakening its political system .
Only two are advisable , but they are not easy to apply and success is not guaranteed .
Three years ago , President Felipe Calderón decided to deploy the armed forces in several states where the main drug gangs are established .
Calderón is trying to check the gangs ' capacity for violence and diminish their economic resources , but he still has not been able to implement a plan that is both successful and minimizes the cost in lives .
The country 's two biggest drug gangs , the Sinaloa and Tamaulipas organizations , were once rivals , but are now allied against their former partners -- the Vicente Carrillo Fuentes , Beltrán-Leyva , and Zetas organizations -- which appeared during Mexico 's long period of one-party rule by the Institutional Revolutionary Party -LRB- PRI -RRB- .
Created in 1929 , the PRI lost the country 's presidency for the first time in 2000 .
Since then , two parallel transitions have been taking place : one toward democracy , and the other , in the field of drug trafficking , toward a paramilitary\/mafioso framework .
It was the Tamaulipas organization that began the latter transition at the end of the 1990 's .
A regional presence corrupting local politicians , it soon expanded its territory and gained control of key positions in municipal and state security institutions .
This was accompanied by an increase in armed violence against the police , the military , and journalists , as well as by incursions into politics and diversification of criminal income through kidnappings , extortion , piracy , and human trafficking .
Paradoxically , the PRI 's loss of its monopoly on political power and the opening of Mexican politics facilitated and accelerated this process .
Parties without pacts , consensus , or a shared vision were made co-responsible in matters of national security , which enhanced the influence of the drug gangs .
None of the areas where illicit drugs are produced , smuggled into the country , and transported into the United States are insulated from drug related-corruption .
Indeed , corruption , including `` protection '' of traffickers , is distributed along the lines of party control in various regions .
The historical subordination of criminal to political power is being undone .
During the 2010 elections in Tamaulipas , a candidate for governor and another one for mayor were assassinated , presumably by `` organized crime . ''
Other candidates received death threats .
In Chihuahua , candidates for office claimed to have received threats , and some asked for police protection .
In Tamaulipas , the Golfo and Zetas gangs , former partners , are fighting to the death .
And in Chihuahua , the state with the highest number of murders in the country , powerful gangs that were once united are now in open confrontation .
The PRI retained power in those states : voters did not make them pay for their share of responsibility for the violence .
But more than 60 % of voters stayed away from the polls .
Mexico 's political class has at least six options in the fight against the narcotics traffickers :
· Do nothing and let the drug gangs impose their lawlessness on society ;
· Make anti-drug policy the exclusive concern of the federal government ;
· Form a strategic partnership with the traffickers in the hope that they keep to a `` gentleman 's agreement '' and commit themselves to lowering the level of violence and avoiding confrontations with police and the military .
This means granting them formal political recognition and acceding to widening the pax mafiosa that already exists in many local jurisdictions ;
· Provide support for partial continuation of Calderón 's strategy , including cooperation agreed with the US to combat transnational organized crime .
US financing will need to be continued , and probably increased , to combat the traffic in illegal drugs , organized crime , and related violence ;
· Create a partnership between political parties join and the federal government to design a national security policy , consolidate law-enforcement institutions , and impose authority throughout the national territory against all illegal armed groups ;
· Radically alter Mexico 's drug policy by legalizing drugs and assuming the consequences in the United Nations and in relations with the US .
Despite the increasingly desperate violence , there is nothing to indicate that Mexico 's political class is even prepared to consider the sixth option .
At present , versions of the other options can be seen .
Achieving the fourth , along with social and economic measures aimed at creating better jobs and improving people 's standard of living , would at least make it possible to weaken , contain , and control Mexico 's drug trafficking organizations , thereby strengthening civil order and governability .
No War of Civilizations
No War of Civilizations
More to the point , this is not a new war .
Terrorism has existed as a political tool in the Middle East for a long time -- and it has been used not only against Israel or the United States .
It was Syrian agents who assassinated Lebanon 's President-elect Beshir Gemayel in 1982 .
Kurdish terrorists have been active in Turkey for decades ; Islamic terrorists assassinated President Anwar Sadat in l981 and later tried to assassinate President Mubarak .
This is not a fight against Western imperialism or globalization .
Nor is it a response to the present violent deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations : some of Osama bin Laden 's terrorist acts against American targets in the mid-1990 's , it should be recalled , occurred at the height of the Israeli-Palestinian honeymoon that followed the Oslo agreements of l993 .
Islam as a religion can be tolerant as well as triumphalist -- as its sister world religion , Christianity , can be .
But there is a strain in extremist Islam that sees modernity -- the whole Enlightenment project -- as its enemy .
For it democracy , equality , political liberalism , separation of state and church , equality between the sexes , secularism -- are all the work of the Devil .
Just like the Anabaptists of Münster , they see themselves as God 's agents in a world corrupted by the sins of materialism and faithlessness .
Such a Manichaean world legitimizes terrorism as the will of God .
For people like Bin Laden -- and it appears that it is his version of Islamic fundamentalism which is behind the terror acts in New York and Washington -- even the Saudi monarchy is evil , because it has facilitated American presence in the Middle East .
For years , some versions of such terrorism have received tacit support from some Arab states .
Even some European countries , for causes deeply rooted in a Machiavellian raison d'etat , have sometimes closed their eyes when confronted with terrorist behavior .
Syria -- a prime source of state-sponsored terrorism -- is now even considered a candidate for a seat in the Security Council .
But just as there could be no moral neutrality in the war against Nazism and Fascism , so the coalition the Americans are now trying to build will begin to take as a root assumption that , if the war against terrorism is to be serious , tolerance of terror-supporting regimes can not go on .
Some terrorists are , no doubt , motivated by legitimate concerns and have legitimate grievances -LRB- the Kurds and the Palestinians come to mind -RRB- .
Yet legitimate goals do not legitimize evil means .
The kind of terrorism which we saw in the l970 's and l980 's -- airline hijacking , the murder of Israeli athletes in the l972 Munich Olympics -- has now mutated into the Islam-inspired Palestinian suicide terrorist , and finally into the Armageddon-like landscape we now see in New York and Washington .
The war ahead will be a difficult one .
The war against Iraq of a decade ago , and the `` virtual '' war without casualties that NATO waged in the skies over Kosovo , offer no precedents .
Indeed , they deluded us for too long into thinking that the war against terrorism was a police matter -- that investigators and indictments were the way to fight fanatical terrorists , not a relentless , painstaking armed struggle .
Those delusions , at long last , ended brutally with the massacres in New York and Washington .
No clear strategies now exist for how the war is to be waged . Strategies , however , will be found .
What would be a tragic is if this struggle against terror became a war of civilizations , of the West against Islam .
For the terrorist vision of Islam is a perversion of it .
But collaborators with terrorism should , and will likely be viewed with the same severity as the terrorists themselves .
Only in this way can this war against the world of the Enlightenment , which is the modern world that stretches across all the oceans and , yes , embraces all its faiths , be won .
How to Target Iraq
How to Target Iraq
In the current debate about policy towards Iraq , two extreme alternatives are usually presented : either extend the military campaign against terrorism to Iraq , or maintain the current uneasy status quo with that country .
Pious talk about reworking the UN sanctions is another version of the second alternative - that is , of doing nothing .
Both alternatives are unpalatable .
Yet preparing a ground war against Iraq - finishing off the unfinished business of the 1991 Gulf War - is a high risk strategy .
Arab countries , already questionable allies in the war against fellow Muslims in Afghanistan , will be even less reliable in a war against fellow Arabs .
The Europeans , let alone the Russians , may demure .
The military odds appear daunting .
Still , letting the status quo continue is equally problematic .
It means that the Iraqi people will continue to suffer - both from Saddam 's brutalities , as well as from the consequences of the sanctions caused by his continued rule .
Moreover , it would continue to send the wrong message to would-be terrorists : you can get away with murder .
The perceived weakness of the US after the embassy bombings in East Africa and the attack on the destroyer the USS Cole no doubt contributed to the audacity of the attacks of September 11
Other options , however , do exist and a combination of them could help bring down Saddam without necessarily engaging in outright military action .
First , local forces opposed to Saddam should be encouraged .
By this I do not mean the loudmouthed but totally ineffective so-called Iraqi Opposition .
The local forces to be encouraged - by special operations people and the provision of arms and training - are the leaders of the southern Shi'a and the northern Kurds .
In the latter case , the infrastructure for support already exists , though it was partially dismantled during the Clinton administration .
In the Shi'a south , still reeling from the brutal suppression of the ill-fated 1991 rebellion , contacts must be created and networks established .
Iraq 's neighbors - Saudi Arabia in the south and Turkey in the north - must be reassured that Shi'a and Kurdish rebellion will not result in the dismantling of Iraq and a change of borders : both countries have legitimate concerns regarding this issue .
With the current much more open regime in Teheran , Riyadh can also be convinced that the dangers from an Iranian-controlled Shi'a entity in southern Iraq are less formidable now than they were in 1991 .
On the other hand , the cozy relationship that now exists between Jordan and Saddam must be addressed , with all sensitivity to Jordan 's dilemmas .
The Iraqi politico-military elite must be both targeted and approached .
Saddam has been masterful at filling most crucial positions in the army and security services with people who come from his Tikriti clan .
But they are far from being a monolithic group : enmity , jealously , anger over the past brutalities and injustices visited upon many of their kin may make some generals and colonels open to suggestions of a coup .
Those suggestions should be premised on a two level approach : first , the US , with UN support , should create a war crimes tribunal to judge Saddam and his top generals : they should know that come the day of reckoning , they will be hunted down like Milosevic and his minions .
One major indictment should deal with the use of poison gas against Kurdish rebels in Halabja during the time of the Iran\/Iraq war .
Parallel to this , and the encouragement of insurrections in Iraq 's south and the north , preparations for a military option should be credibly enhanced .
But with the stick should come a carrot : with good intelligence , some Iraqi generals and colonels should be approached with offers of amnesty and support should they decide to try to topple Saddam .
Failure to act , they should be told in no uncertain terms , will leave them exposed -LRB- like Saddam -RRB- to an indictment by in an international war crimes tribunal once Saddam 's rule is brought to an end .
They should also be offered the lifting of sanctions on Iraq provided that they - after getting rid of Saddam - accept the resumption of a UN inspection regime .
One premise underlies this entire line of thought : to imagine that there is a democratic alternative to Saddam , or that once he disappears there will be a democratic transition in Iraq , is to entertain dangerous illusions .
The only alternative to Saddam 's regime is some sort of military rule , but one less oppressive and relatively more open .
It must certainly be committed to a foreign and internal policy not based on terrorism and thuggery and a Saddam-like quest for weapons of mass destruction .
Here , undoubtedly , is a complicated strategy , and one with its own inherent pitfalls .
One key advantage of it is that such an approach has a real chance of gaining support , albeit sometimes tacit , from Arab countries - and from Europe and Russia as well .
Such a calibrated approach , however , combining a differentiated understanding of the nature of Saddam 's regime and its weaknesses , has a better chance of success than an outright assault , or the dangers inherent in allowing Saddam to remain in power .
The successes in Afghanistan call for an equally nuanced and sophisticated approach in regard to Iraq .
Palestinian Refugees and German Expellees
Palestinian Refugees and German Expellees
The atmosphere could not have been more tranquil : a former royal castle in the rolling hills of the Taunus region near Frankfurt , where statesmen and politicians held an annual meeting dealing with the Middle East .
Europeans and Americans , Israelis and Iranians , Egyptians and Turks , Palestinians and Tunisians rubbed shoulders .
The novelty this year was the presence of representatives from post-Saddam Iraq , among them an official from the Kurdish Regional Government , as well as a high ranking Shi'a representative .
The new situation in Iraq , along with the Middle East road map , were at the center of attention .
On the opening night , a senior German government minister , himself deeply involved in Middle Eastern affairs , addressed both subjects , displaying great sensitivity both to Israeli and Palestinian concerns .
The evening proceeded along the expected anodyne trajectory until a Lebanese academic raised the issue of the right of Palestinian refugees to return to Israel .
The senior German minister listened attentively , and then said : `` This is an issue with which we in Germany are familiar ; may I ask my German colleagues in the audience to raise their hand if they , or their families , have been refugees from Eastern Europe ? ''
There was a moment of silence .
The issue is embarrassing in Germany , fraught with political and moral landmines .
Slowly , hands were raised : by my count , more than half of the Germans present -LRB- government officials , journalists , businessmen -RRB- raised a hand : they , or their families , had been Vertriebene -- expelled from their ancestral homes in Poland , Czechoslovakia , Hungary , and Yugoslavia after World War II .
It is estimated that up to 10 million were expelled , and with their descendants they make up today almost double that number -- almost one in four Germans .
In the hushed room , the senior German minister continued : he himself was born in Eastern Europe , and his family was expelled in the post-1945 anti-German atmosphere . `` But , '' he added , `` neither I nor any of my colleagues claim the right to go back .
The minister went on to explain that peace in Europe is today embedded in this realization : if East European countries had thought that millions of ethnic Germans would like to return , `` the Iron Curtain would have never come down . ''
It was a highly emotional response to the Lebanese academic 's question -- one that Arab representatives chose later on to ignore .
But it was just one more expression of the context in which the issue of the 1948 Palestinian refugees has to be addressed .
As the German senior minister reminded the audience , there are numerous parallels in recent history to the Palestinian refugee problem .
Anyone who now claims that the 1948 Palestinian refugees have a claim , in principle , to return to Israel , must confront the question : should the millions of Germans expelled from Eastern Europe after 1945 also have the same right of return to their lost homes ?
The German minister supplied the answer .
Similarly , if Helmut Kohl 's government had insisted in 1990 that all Germans expelled from Poland and Czechoslovakia have a right to return to those countries , German reunification would not have gained the broad international agreement that it did .
It would be clear that what West Germany had in mind was not reunification , but reversing the consequences of Nazi Germany 's defeat in 1945 .
The Palestinians ' demand for the right of return has an analogous meaning .
Insistence on it in 2000 at Camp David and Taba made clear to most Israelis that what the Palestinians have in mind is not undoing the consequences of the Six Day War in 1967 .
Rather , the demand for a right of return amounts to an effort to reverse the consequences of their defeat in 1948 , when the Arab world went to war to prevent the state of Israel from being born .
It is worth keeping in mind what advocates of a Palestinian right of return now prefer to forget : Palestinian Arabs and four Arab members of the UN went to war in 1948 not only against Israel , but against international legitimacy and the UN plan for a two-state solution .
There is no other example of UN member countries going to war to prevent implementation of UN decisions .
This is what the Arab countries and the Palestinians did .
Clearly there is a serious humanitarian issue involved .
The fact that the refugees ' plight was compounded by their use as political pawns for half a century is a measure of the cynicism and immorality of Arab political leadership .
Nonetheless , the humanitarian issue remains .
The senior German minister referred to it explicitly , both with regard to the Palestinians and the post-1945 German refugees .
But the political consequences for him were clear : the revanchist call for a return of refugees -- in both the German and the Palestinian case -- is a formula for instability , if not war .
America 's mounting difficulties in setting up a coherent form of government in Iraq , let alone a democratic one , inspire a question that most statesmen consider unthinkable : is it possible that there is no way to re-constitute Iraq as one state , and that alternative options must be considered , unpalatable as they may appear ?
Like so many problems in the re-birth of states wounded by dictatorship -- Eastern Europe is a good example -- Iraq 's difficulties have deep historical roots .
To blame everything on the heavy-handedness of the Americans is too simplistic and shallow , even if their mistakes have , indeed , been legion .
Iraq was established in the 1920 's by the British , who occupied the region after the Ottoman Empire disintegrated at the end of WWI .
Their policies were dictated by British imperial interests , and gave no consideration to the wishes , interests , or characteristics of the local population .
What British imperial planners did was to stitch together three disparate provinces of the old Ottoman Empire and put at their head a prince from Hedjaz -LRB- now a part of Saudi Arabia -RRB- .
The three provinces -- Mosul , Baghdad , and Basra -- each had very distinct characters and very different population structures .
Mosul had a Kurdish majority , with significant Assyrian-Christian and Turkoman minorities ; Baghdad was mainly Sunni ; and Basra was predominantly Shi'ite .
Throwing such disparate groups into one body politic doomed the newly invented country to decades of strife and repression .
The old Ottoman Empire ruled these three provinces -- as it ruled all of its imperial possessions -- through its historically autocratic means .
The challenge facing the new Iraqi state was to try to create a non-despotic , relatively representative form of government in which all sectors of the population would find an expression of their political will .
This turned out to be an impossible mission .
For this reason Iraq -- even before Saddam Hussein -- always suffered the most repressive regime of any Arab state .
In a country where Shi'ites form the majority , the Sunnis -- traditionally the hegemonic group in all Arab countries -- were totally unwilling to allow any democratic process to jeopardize their rule .
A Shi'ite insurrection was brutally put down in the 1920 's -LRB- with the help of the British Royal Air Force -RRB- .
Similarly , Kurdish attempts at autonomy before WWII were drowned in bloody massacres of tens of thousands of innocent civilians , and even the Assyrian Christian minority -- a relatively small group , with no political ambitions -- was exposed to murderous assaults in the 1930 's .
Under these conditions , with the Sunni ruling minority constantly feeling threatened , it was no accident that the only attempt in any Arab country to establish something like a pro-Nazi fascist regime occurred in Iraq in the early 1940 's under Rashid Ali al-Khailani .
The British suppressed this misadventure , but not before hundreds of Jews in Baghdad were murdered in a wild farhood -LRB- pogrom -RRB- instigated by the short-lived pro-Nazi government .
Saddam 's regime was merely the most extreme manifestation of the harsh underlying fact that Iraq 's geography and demography condemned it to rule by the iron fist .
Nor has Saddam 's fall changed this fact : anti-US violence is not only an expression of anger at foreign occupation ; it is also a Sunni attempt to abort the establishment of a democratic order that would put them -- the historical masters -- in a subordinate position .
Similarly , one can not see the Kurds in the north submitting willingly to a Baghdad-dominated Arab regime , let alone a Shi'ite one -LRB- most Kurds are Sunnis -RRB- .
There is little understanding in the West of how deep the Sunni\/Shi ` ite divide runs .
Put yourself in pre-1648 Europe , a time when Protestants and Catholics slaughtered each other with abandon , and you 'll understand the enmity immediately .
So what can be done ?
Yugoslavia 's example shows that in multi-ethnic and multi-religious countries deeply riven by conflict , partition and separation may be the only way to ensure stability and democratization .
There is no doubt today that Croatia and Serbia -- despite their difficulties -- stand a better chance of becoming more or less stable democracies than if they were still fighting for mastery among themselves within the Procrustean bed of the former Yugoslavia .
Nor is federation an alternative -- as the terms of the federation itself become the bones of contention -LRB- see Bosnia or Cyprus -RRB- .
Even the pacific Czechs and Slovaks found it easier to develop their respective democratic structures through a velvet divorce rather than be joined in an unworkable marriage .
The time has come to think the unthinkable , about creating a Kurdish state in the north , an Arab Sunni one in the center around Baghdad , and an Arab Shi'ite state in the south around Basra .
Repeating mantras about territorial integrity -- the conventional wisdom of international relations -- is productive only as long as it ensures stability and averts chaos .
Again , as Yugoslavia -- and the Soviet Union -- showed , once strife replaces stability , territorial integrity loses its strategic meaning and legitimacy .
This is not a universal prescription for ethnically homogenous states .
The point is simply that there are moments in history when democratization and nation building coincide , and that in deeply divided societies the minimum consensus needed for both to succeed simultaneously is difficult to achieve .
All this may run contrary to conventional wisdom , but who thought that the USSR would disintegrate ?
Creative and innovative thinking is needed about Iraq ; otherwise today 's mayhem will continue -- and worsen .
A Referendum For Kurdistan ?
A Referendum For Kurdistan ?
The assassination of the President of Iraq 's Governing Council makes it crystal clear that the US is failing to create the minimal law-and-order needed for any sort of orderly transfer of power to take place by June 30th .
Barely two months ago , the signing of a constitutional document by a US-appointed group of un-elected Iraqi officials was heralded as if it were the re-enactment of America 's constitutional convention in Philadelphia in 1787 .
No imposed constitution , however elegant it may be , will be very helpful to Coalition forces when confronted with the type of mayhem seen in towns like Fallujah or Najjaf .
In the Kurdish region of northern Iraq , however , the situation is completely different : in the last ten years , under the protection of the Allies ' no-fly zone , and even more so since the toppling of Saddam , the Kurdish regional government has been able to establish and sustain a relatively orderly administration .
It has overcome tribal and party differences and created a de facto functioning government , with an impressive record on development issues such as education , irrigation , and construction - and , above all , with no violence .
Confronted with the debacle in the rest of -LRB- Arab -RRB- Iraq , the question has to be asked why the US-led coalition should not hold a referendum in the Kurdish region , asking the population how they would like to be ruled .
After all , the Kurds have , by any internationally accepted standards , a right to self-determination .
Historically , the Kurds - who are distinct in language , culture , and historical consciousness from Arabs - never had their day in court .
After World War I and the fall of the Ottoman Empire , the victorious Allies promised them a state of their own - a promise that was cynically betrayed when British and French imperial interests took precedence .
Since then , the Kurds have suffered under the despotic rule of rival ethnic groups .
There are obvious obstacles to holding such a referendum , primarily because the US does not have a mandate to dispose of Iraq as it pleases .
But the same goes for the rest of Iraq : the US is now lamely asking for a UN resolution mandating a transfer of power to a legitimate Iraqi government - but such an authorization is highly unlikely , nor is there anyone in Iraq to whom authority can conceivably be transferred .
Why should the one region - and people - who run an orderly government , are not involved in murder , attacks on mosques , and suicide bombing of schoolchildren , be penalized ?
Another objection is the opposition of Turkey - and , to a lesser degree , Iran and Syria - to granting the Iraqi Kurds self-determination .
But if one thinks in terms of universal norms of human rights , what right has Turkey to dictate internal development in another country ?
After all , nobody accepts Israel 's claim to oppose as a matter of principle the establishment of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza .
The same should apply to Turkey .
If Turkey grants its own Kurdish minority more cultural and language rights and allows legitimate Kurdish political representation in the Turkish parliament , the willingness of Turkish Kurds to oppose Ankara will be diminished .
In the nineteenth century , the joint interests of the authoritarian Russian , German , and Austrian Empires prevented the establishment of a free Poland : such unholy alliances have no place in the twenty-first century .
Recently , under the aegis of the UN , a referendum on the future of Cyprus was held within the island 's Greek and Turkish communities .
The outcome was paradoxical , and not to the liking of those who initiated it : but the right of the communities to determine their future was accepted .
Why not in Iraqi Kurdistan ?
Perhaps to assuage political fears - and considerations of international law - any plebiscite in the Kurdish region should , initially , have only a consultative status .
Such a referendum may also concentrate minds among the Arab Sunnis and Shia in Iraq , when they come to realize that it is their violence that is dismantling Iraq .
Perhaps they may decide that violence is counter-productive and carries its own penalties , and may then follow the Kurdish example of curbing violence , which would help put Iraq together again without recourse to permanent repression .
If not , at the very least , the injustice suffered by the Kurdish people for generations would , at long last , be rectified .
The Refugee Dilemma
The Refugee Dilemma
One reason Greek Cypriots rejected last April UN Secretary General Kofi Annan 's plan for the reunification of Cyprus was that an overwhelming majority of them felt it did not do justice to the claims of refugees displaced during the 1974 Turkish invasion .
This was also one of the few occasions when international public opinion became aware that there was a refugee problem on the island , because few people knew that refugees from that war still exist .
When Turkey invaded Cyprus in 1974 after an abortive attempt by the Greek military junta in Athens to carry out Enosis -LRB- unification with Greece -RRB- , 250,000 or so Greek Cypriots were uprooted from their homes .
Some fled in terror from the invading army , some were expelled - the usual complex , morally problematic picture that emerges in such situations .
Although overwhelmed , the Greek Cypriot community reacted with humanity , solidarity , and prudence .
Initially , refugees camps were set up , but the Greek Cypriot government decided that while it will not surrender the refugees ' claim eventually to return to their homes in the North , it would do its utmost in the interim not to leave them vegetating in squalid camps .
No UN-sponsored refugee agency was established to help the refugees .
Instead , with some international help , but mostly out of its own resources , the Republic of Cyprus - a small , then not very prosperous country that was devastated by war - launched a re-settlement and rehabilitation program as a national project .
Government loans were offered for housing construction .
In many cases , refugees built their own new homes .
Businesses were encouraged with government subsidies and loans . Schools and training centers were established .
Within a few years , the refugees were absorbed into the economy and society of the southern , Greek Cypriot sector of the island .
As in post-World War II West Germany , much of the current prosperity in Cyprus today is an outcome of the boost the economy received from the absorption of refugees .
Anyone visiting the Greek Cypriot part of the island nowadays will not find refugee camps : most of the millions of tourists are unaware of the fact that more than a third of the Greek Cypriots they encounter are refugees or descendants of refugees .
The Greek Cypriot community can justly be proud of the way they handled the humanitarian and social problems of the refugees , without at any point surrendering their claims to the lands they lost .
Equally commendable has been the Greek Cypriot strategic decision to follow a Gandhi-like policy of non-violence : while there is deep bitterness about the Turkish occupation , and the fact that Turkish settlers were implanted in the North , the Greek Cypriot community decided not to use violence against the occupation .
Not one incident of Greek Cypriot terrorism or violence against Turkish occupation has occurred in more than a quarter of a century .
This is also one of the reasons few people have ever heard about the Greek Cypriot refugees .
It could , of course , be different : had Greek Cypriots followed the Palestinian example since 1948 - that is , kept the refugees in camps , segregated them from the non-refugee society , and fed their children a daily militaristic message of hatred , revenge , and terrorism - a completely different atmosphere would permeate the island .
The Greek Cypriot example shows that it is simply not true that the occupied have no recourse other than violence and terrorism .
Recourse to violence and terror is a moral and strategic choice .
The Greek Cypriots chose the path of non-violence ; the Palestinians chose the opposite route .
There is always a choice , and there are always consequences .
Consider what the Greek Cypriot community has achieved - a thriving economy , no one living under conditions of misery and humiliation in camps , membership in the European Union - compared to the catastrophe the Palestinian choice has brought to their own people . Perhaps on the level of public relations , the Palestinian leadership - sacrificing their own people on the altar of propaganda - can bask in their achievement : yet it is their own people who suffer .
These leaders would do better to look across the Mediterranean at Cyprus and see how - without giving up claims to disputed land - refugees can live in dignity and honor .
But then again , the Republic of Cyprus is a democracy , while the Palestinians have not been able to emancipate themselves from the violent militarized option that has brought them such misery .
The Other Palestinian Revolution
The Other Palestinian Revolution
The euphoria that has , for over a week , greeted Mahmoud Abbas 's election as President of the Palestinian Authority was perhaps justified .
But now it is time for a clear-eyed assessment of what lies before Palestinians , Israelis , and , perhaps more importantly , for the wider Arab world .
Such an assessment requires acknowledging that the election was far from flawless : Hamas and Islamic Jihad boycotted the poll , and Marwan Barghouti , a fellow Fatah member with Abbas and the one candidate who could seriously have challenged him , was ungently persuaded by the movement 's leadership to withdraw his candidacy in order to present a unified front .
Moreover , Abbas -LRB- also known as Abu Mazen -RRB- succeeded in getting the dozen or so Palestinian security services and militias under his control .
This guaranteed his victory , though the parades of armed men brandishing guns at his rallies were not exactly what democratic norms call for .
Yet the fact remains that after decades of Yasir Arafat 's autocratic rule , and despite the obvious constraints of continued Israeli occupation , the Palestinians did elect a leader in a relatively free and competitive election .
For years , Arafat avoided holding elections , as required by the laws of the Palestinian Authority , under the pretense that they can not be held under occupation : but , lo and behold , two months after his demise , an election was held - and with resounding success .
The presidential election will obviously serve as a catalyst for renewed , and possibly more successful , negotiations with Israel .
But the impact of the Palestinian vote will also be watched closely in the Arab world , because what happened in the West Bank and Gaza is unparalleled in the annals of Arab politics .
Abbas will now bask in the glow of having been elected .
Is Palestinian society so different from other Arab societies ? Not really .
But there were several unique factors in the Palestinian context .
First , there was strong external pressure : confronted and exasperated by Arafat 's deviousness and autocratic style , the United States and the European Union clearly told the Palestinians that any future support for their quest for independence would depend on their going through a reasonably acceptable democratic process .
Second , most Palestinians perceived that their ability to go through such a democratic process was itself a significant step in their struggle against Israel .
Finally , Palestinians have been exposed not only to the obvious hardships of occupation while living under Israeli rule for the better part of four decades ; they were also able to experience , at close range , a liberal democracy at work - a free press , an independent judiciary , and political pluralism .
The dialectic of occupation plays strange games , both with occupier and occupied .
The Palestinian elections were seen all over the Arab world on Al-Jazeera and other Arab TV channels .
They must have focused people 's minds on their own stunted political conditions . If the Palestinians , under Israeli occupation , can choose their own leaders , why ca n't the same happen in Cairo or Damascus , in Ryadh or Algiers ?
Perhaps a time bomb has been planted under the thrones of Arab potentates - kings , emirs and presidents .
While Iraq - an attempt to import democracy by force - is failing , the paradoxical conditions of an Arab democracy under Israeli occupation may be a threat that Arab rulers have not yet comprehended .
Hamas in Power
The victory of the fundamentalist Hamas in the Palestinian elections will have far-reaching consequences for the region , some totally unexpected .
Two aspects , however , are already visible .
The Hamas victory is , first and foremost , an indication of the total failure of the traditional Palestinian leadership to create a body politic .
Palestine is not yet a state , but it is already a failed one .
Since the Oslo Accords of l993 between Israel and the PLO , the Palestinians enjoyed limited transitional autonomy .
To be sure , the new Palestinian Authority -LRB- PA -RRB- took power under difficult conditions , but which new liberation movement does not face serious challenges when it finally must govern ?
The PA had an opportunity to lay the institutional foundations for a functioning state .
But , but instead of supplying the population with the necessary infrastructure -- economic development , education , welfare , medical services , housing , and refugee rehabilitation -- Yasser Arafat 's Fatah-led PA spent more than 70 % of its meager budget on a dozen competing security and intelligence services , neglecting all other spheres of activity .
It created what is called in Arabic a Mukhabarat -LRB- security services -RRB- state , very much like what is prevalent in almost all Arab countries -- Egypt , Syria , Saudi Arabia , republics and monarchies alike .
The vacuum that the PA left elsewhere , including the social sphere , was filled by Hamas .
Indeed , its popularity is due not only to its fundamentalist Islamic ideology and its commitment to the destruction of Israel .
The high esteem in which Palestinians hold Hamas also grew out of what Hamas actually did for them while the PA squandered its resources .
It was not only the endemic corruption of the official Palestinian leadership that turned so many Palestinians from it .
Hamas set up better schools , kindergartens , crèches for mothers , medical centers , welfare services , and programs for youth and women -- all of this in addition giving special grants to the families of suicide bombers .
In the elections , Hamas received its dividend for doing what the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority failed to do .
It is still an open question whether Hamas in government will become more pragmatic and less committed to terrorism : it certainly is a possibility , and one should not prejudge the outcome .
But nor , on the other hand , is it clear that the existing organs of the Palestinian Authority -- especially the security services at its disposal -- will allow a peaceful transfer of power . Indeed , no such precedent exists : there has never been a peaceful transfer of power in any of the Arab League 's 22 member states .
Israel 's response to Hamas 's victory will obviously be complicated by its own elections on March 28 , and by a government headed by an interim prime minister , Ehud Olmert , owing to Sharon 's incapacitation just weeks after leaving Likud and founding a new , centrist party , Kadima -LRB- Forward -RRB- .
Despite Sharon 's absence , Kadima maintains its lead in public opinion polls -- the most recent gave it 44 of the Knesset 's 120 seats , compared to 21 for Labor and 14 for the right-wing rump-Likud , under Binyamin Netanyahu .
Kadima 's success is due to Sharon 's main innovation in Israeli politics : the successful unilateral disengagement from Gaza .
That withdrawal was based on the conviction that the gaps between the Israeli and Palestinian positions are too wide to enable meaningful negotiations .
Hence , Israel must start deciding the future boundaries of the country unilaterally , hoping for eventual negotiations at a later stage .
This is also the line adopted by Olmert .
But Hamas 's victory suggests that the gaps between the Israeli and Palestinian sides will grow even wider , and that the chances for a negotiated settlement will recede even farther into the future .
This leaves further unilateral Israeli moves -- such as a partial set of withdrawals from selected areas in the West Bank -- as the only feasible option .
Realistic conflict management will replace utopian hopes for conflict resolution .
In a region full of paradoxes , the Hamas victory may have added another one : usually , when extremists on one side become stronger , it plays into the hands of extremists on the other side , producing a dangerous spiral effect .
In this case , however , the victory of the extremist Hamas may strengthen not the extremists of Likud , but , surprisingly , the more moderate centrists of Kadima .
One can not be certain of such an outcome , of course , but it is now the best that one can realistically hope for .
Can Hamas Stay in Power ?
With one-third of the Palestinians ' Hamas-led government now under arrest by Israel , the escalation in Israeli-Palestinian relations has moved beyond military confrontation .
A far more fundamental question has come into view : can a Palestinian government that draws its authority from an agreement with Israel stay in power when it is led by an organization committed to the destruction of Israel ?
The abduction of an Israeli soldier in the Gaza Strip , as well as the abduction and subsequent murder of an 18-year old Israeli civilian in the West Bank , have brought to the fore that question , which has haunted Israeli-Palestinian relations since Hamas won parliamentary elections in January .
The international community , led by the `` Quartet '' -LRB- the United States , the European Union , the United Nations , and Russia -RRB- , has put three conditions to the Hamas government if it wishes to achieve international legitimacy and continue to be supported financially .
Hamas must recognize Israel 's right to exist , stop all terrorist activities , and commit itself to carry out all previous international agreements signed by the Palestinian Authority .
These look like reasonable conditions to any outside observer .
To Hamas , however , they appear to undermine its very raison d'etre .
After all , this is an organization committed to the destruction of Israel -- its charter calls for a holy war against all Jews -- and the establishment of an Islamic state in all of historical Palestine .
So it is no great surprise that Hamas rejected the Quartet 's conditions .
At the same time , Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas -LRB- Abu Mazen -RRB- , who represents Fatah , which lost the January elections , has tried in vain to find common ground with Hamas through an ambiguous text known as `` The Prisoners ' Document . ''
This document was intended to serve as an implicit acceptance of Israel 's right to exist .
But nothing of the sort appears in the truncated text approved by Hamas .
On the contrary , the text legitimizes continuing attacks against Israeli civilians in the West Bank , making it unacceptable to Israel -- and to the international community .
But the current crisis can not be solved by words alone .
One of the paradoxical results of America 's almost messianic belief in elections as a panacea for all the ills of the Middle East is that Hamas -- the winner of democratic elections -- has gained a degree of legitimacy that it never had before .
On the other hand , Hamas 's history and current behavior clearly indicate that it regards elections as merely a political tool , and that it is devoid of any commitment to the norms and values underlying democracy .
Fascist and communist regimes of the past , which followed a similar instrumentalist approach to democracy , come to mind here .
Yet , at the same time , the US supports Abu Mazen , trying to undermine the Hamas government , thus casting a shadow on the credibility of its own commitment to democracy .
The current violence may escalate further , and could bring down the Hamas government .
But the fundamental problem is that , until now , at every historical juncture , the Palestinians refused to accept a compromise and consequently failed in nation-building .
In 1947 , they refused the UN partition plan , which called for the establishments of two states in British Palestine .
In 1993 , after the Oslo agreements , the Palestinian Authority established under Yasir Arafat became another militarized authoritarian regime , very much like Syria and Egypt , and did nothing to alleviate the suffering of the Palestinian refugees .
It was this failure that brought Hamas to power .
The current crisis is obviously the first serious test for Olmert and his plans for further withdrawal from Israeli-occupied territories .
But it is an even greater test for the Palestinians : will they once again be led by a radical and fanatical leadership into another national catastrophe ?
Or will they finally realize that a future of independence , sovereignty , and dignity is open to them -- but only if they grant the Israelis what they rightly claim for themselves ?
The international community can urge the Palestinians toward a decision .
But that decision , and its moral costs , remains in the hands of the Palestinians alone .
Will Olmert Survive ?
Will Olmert Survive ? After Israel 's inability last summer to achieve a conclusive victory over Hezbollah in southern Lebanon , public pressure forced Prime Minister Ehud Olmert 's government to appoint a commission to examine the causes of this surprising failure .
How could a small militia , numbering less than a few thousand combatants , survive the onslaught of the Middle
