In addition , the EU provided financing , whereas the European Central Bank , which could have given swap credits , played no helpful role .
Rural populations from Africa have the capacity to compete and export greenhouse-gas emission-reduction credits generated by forestry and agriculture activities that improve their livelihoods , ameliorate local environmental problems , and increase communities ' ability to cope with climate change .
Europe , in particular , can demonstrate its commitment to mitigating climate change and promoting economic development in Africa by filling its 1 % quota of credits from reforestation projects .
Under current EU ETS rules , carbon credits generated by forestry projects undertaken in the CDM currently have no value , despite their obvious climate , environmental , and social benefits .
This is because the so-called `` linking directive '' -- the regulation authorizing EU firms to import Certified Emission Reductions from CDM projects -- bans credits from any forestry project .
Unsurprisingly , no European firm is currently interested in purchasing such credits .
The EU ETS 's exclusion of carbon credits from forestry projects will remain in force at least until 2008 , with the question of whether to include them subsequently set to be revisited next year .
Preserving the European bias against credits from forest projects is not justified , as positive experience emerging from the first land-use projects will show .
In particular , three changes are necessary : the relaxation of the 1 % rule , the expansion of eligibility criteria to include more than just reforestation , and the removal of the 60-year replacement rule -LRB- which mandates the replacement of temporary with permanent credits after 60 years , regardless of the state of the underlying forests -RRB- .
The first change would enable Annex I countries to satisfy a greater share of their increasing climate responsibilities using credits from land-use projects implemented in non-Annex I countries . The second change would allow forestry and land-use projects that are eligible to issue carbon credits to include such activities as re-vegetation , forest restoration , and improved agricultural management .
The third change would eliminate a perverse rule , by which parties to CDM contracts can liquidate forests to buy replacement credits .
It may well be resolved with different answers that accord with different countries ' traditions , although tax credits and similar additions to people 's incomes are more compatible with free societies .
We are talking about either direct government employment programs , or large tax credits for businesses that increase the number of workers they employ .
Another compelling explanation comes from a venture capitalist who credits Chinese society with copious reserves of entrepreneurial energy that derives , he believes , from the fact that Chinese culture attaches very little shame to failing in a business enterprise .
Instead , they use the language of realpolitik and remind us that we are too weak to challenge the West , and that our economy - devastated by war , sanctions and NATO bombing - desperately needs the loans and credits that come under the condition that extraditions to the Hague are made .
The other fashionable policy idea that will ultimately prove impractical is to transform the IMF credits known as Special Drawing Rights into an international currency to rival the dollar . The problem is that SDRs are used neither to settle cross-border transactions nor as a unit in which to denominate international bonds .
In addition , in order for the SDR to become a true global currency , the IMF would have to be empowered to issue more of them in a crisis , much like the US Federal Reserve provided foreign central banks with $ 120 billion in emergency credits following the collapse of Lehman Brothers .
But skeptics question whether the SDR could ever replace the dollar as the world 's leading reserve currency , for the simple reason that the SDR is not a currency . It is a composite accounting unit in which the IMF issues credits to its members .
Those credits can be converted into dollars and other currencies at the Fund , and can be used in official transactions among IMF member countries . But they can not be used in the other transactions in which central banks and governments engage .
Its credits and swaps have never been activated .
Now , we are told , ASEAN +3 has achieved another great breakthrough , the so-called Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization -LRB- CMIM -RRB- , aimed at turning its bilateral swaps and credits into a regional reserve pool .
Disbursing more than 20 % of the credits available to a country still requires that it first reach an agreement with the IMF , and 20 % of a country 's entitlement is actually less than it contributes to the pool .
But make no mistake : Putin 's popularity ratings relied not on his vigor , humor , or mystique , but on salaries and credits that Russians had never enjoyed before .
Using bank credits to speculate in equity and housing markets is still mostly forbidden .
Inflation soared to 21 % in 1994 -- its highest level over the past 30 years -- and a great deal of local debt ended up as non-performing loans , which amounted to 40 % of total credits in the state banking sector in the mid-1990 's .
The combination of credits from the other eurozone countries and lending by the IMF may provide enough liquidity to stave off default for a while .
Belarus 's economy can function only if Russia subsidizes energy prices and allocates non-repayable credits .
It is inevitably a long road from a starting point where credits are channeled to state-owned enterprises through state-owned banks to an economic environment in which interest rates are a proper indicator of monetary policy .
China can handle its large banks , even if they have large portfolios of poor credits .
The reported abuse of micro-credits to pay dowries is one alarming example .
Indeed , the IMF 's outstanding general resource account -LRB- GRA -RRB- credits to middle-income developing countries fell by an unprecedented 91 % from 2002 to 2007 , as richer developing countries gained access to sources of financing that were free of the Fund 's conditionality .
In contrast to 1929 , credits are not now being throttled ; on the contrary , public money is being pumped into banks and the economy .
In its current state , cap-and-trade schemes to reduce emissions are far from being fair and effective ; a major improvement would include establishing a Central Climate Bank to register and supervise the transfer of emissions credits .
This bank would also ensure that emissions trading did not run counter to the goal of remaining within the entire global budget , for example via the complete sale of unused emissions credits by individual developing countries at the beginning of the contract period .
Even before the recent global financial crisis and subsequent recession , governments around the world provided support to the private sector through direct subsidies , tax credits , or loans from development banks in order to bolster growth and support job creation .
The US went from owing $ 3 billion -LRB- mostly to Great Britain -RRB- to being a net creditor for about the same amount , thanks to $ 6 billion in war credits given to the Western Allies .
A further $ 3 billion in credits for European post-war reconstruction cemented America 's status as the world 's premier creditor nation , with its surplus equal to roughly 8 % of GNP at the time .
The International Monetary Fund credits Asian intra-regional trade as the main factor behind its recent export boom and strong economic growth .
The best way to implement this strategy is to use a `` carbon credit trading system '' in the advanced countries , with each advanced country receiving a certain amount of carbon credits to determine its permissible emission levels .
If a country exceeds its level of emissions , it must buy additional credits from other countries that achieve emissions lower than their permitted levels .
But an advanced country could also undertake mitigation efforts in the developing world and thus earn additional credits equal to the full value of its mitigation efforts -LRB- thus allowing more emissions at home -RRB- .
As for developing countries , while they would not have explicit credits or targets until they graduate to advanced-country status , they would know that at some point -LRB- say , when their carbon emissions reach the average level of advanced countries -RRB- they would be included in the global system of restrictions .
Credit risk is best hedged through diversification across uncorrelated credits .
Brazil 's bosses are cheering as loudly as its trade unionists for Lula nowadays , which is no surprise given the huge sums being spent on infrastructure , owing to massive public spending , the lavish capital-expenditure program of Petrobras , Brazil 's state oil company , and credits provided by state-owned banks to low-income housing .
The firms earn cap-and-trade carbon credits to fulfill their Kyoto requirements .
The immediate problem is a credit crunch not so much in China as in the United States and Europe , where many small and medium-size importers can not get the trade credits they need to buy inventory from abroad .
Of course , there were abuses , such as the allocation of public credits to richer farmers rather than to needy ones , or the prolonged subsidization of inputs even after farmers became creditworthy .
So long as the credits are long term and carry a modest interest rate -LRB- say , 25-year dollar loans at 5 % per annum -RRB- , the recipient countries could repay the loans out of the significant boost in incomes that would result over the course of a generation .
Low-income people who could not be expected ever to repay their loans were given so-called NINJA credits : `` No income , no job , no assets . ''
Greece , Ireland , Portugal , and Spain 's collective draw on Target credits forced the Bundesbank to reduce the refinancing credit that it issued by about ¤ 30 billion per year from 2008 to the end of 2010 , when it stood at barely ¤ 90 billion .
Failure discredits only the party or coalition in power , not the entire political system .
For example , formerly communist countries earned emission credits at zero cost on the heavy industries that they had to shut down and reaped windfall profits by selling them .
There is a widely held view that IMF rescue packages have actually contributed to the crisis by creating what economists speak of as `` moral hazard '' -- the expectation by market participants that the IMF could be counted on to rescue countries in trouble , and thus to bail out investors who provided credits to them .
The hiccups in Western banks have served to disrupt the availability of trade credits , and , if amplified , could destabilize local banks .
But some of the simplest and most important precepts , formulated well before these micro-foundations were well established -- such as the fact that temporary income tax cuts are unlikely to be effective , while temporary investment tax credits can be extremely powerful -- are as valid today as ever .
Centering attention on reactivation makes clear why the focus on IMF credits is misguided .
IMF credits will go to repay the IMF , not to reactivate the economy .
· The Kyoto Protocol 's Clean Development Mechanism allows for the trade of carbon credits for reforestation .
This process is already underway , particularly in Italy and France , through cuts in social security contributions for lower-paid workers , tighter conditions for drawing unemployment benefits , and tax credits for `` the working poor . ''
At the least , companies should earn carbon credits for the CO2 they capture and store .
The state , which is seeking to rescue the domestic automobile industry , allocated to the firm more credits through state-owned banks .
